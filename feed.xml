I read slow.  To make the matter worse, I only read when I feel the mood for reading.  I don’t force myself reading ever.  However, I treat reading as a part of personal development and that I take super seriously.  On a daily basis, I work on spending 1 hour to 2 hours on minimum (more than that is hard) on independent personal development activities.  Though it only represents 4% to 8% of daily time, keeping this habit going is challenging.  Still, I have no doubt this commitment will compound through time and be a major contributor to what I can do in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I mean about independent personal development activies is the “extra” learnings I do on my own personal time beyond regular professional works.  Of course, when you work, you learn new things, and you grow.  That’s good, but generally not enough.  Besides reactive reasons that the world is now changing fast and who don’t adapt will fail and competition is happening on global scale and some rivals will snap you from the darkness yadi yadi yadi.  I think one of the key thinking on this front is: How far can you go?  For me now, I no longer mind on the world changing fast argument nor global competition argument.  I accepted that reality and moved past that.  What I care now is am I achieving what I’m capable of? or what’s the limit of my capability? I want to explore those out.  This view shift personal development become more of a personal journey.  Personal development is then no longer a forced thing where we have to react to adversity changes but a journey that we embrace and joyfully take to explore things we know will be exciting but we don’t know their existence yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come back to reading, reading is a great mean to learn.  I always say that if a person, let say Ray Dalio, spends his whole life building BridgeWater and achieves what he is capable of and then writes a books about it and sells for $18.  Then I can just buy the book and spend 20 hours reading it (I read slow) and learn his lessons.  That’s a phenomenal bargain.  On the same view, I’m after Peter Drucker’ books, David Rubenstein’s book (he is writing one), Malcolm Gladwell’s books, Peter Thiel’s books, Thich Nhat Hanh’s books, Aswarth Damodaran’s books and many other world-class thinkers that I admire.  As far as my memory goes, Bill Gates and David Rubenstein read no less than 50 books a year about a wide variety of topics.  My thinking is if these people at the top of the world spend their precious time and learn that ferrociously, then there is no excuse for younger people like me don’t take learning seriously.  The now generation when they die should not hand over the world to a lesser capable generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big picture thinking aside, reading does offer some great benefits beyond just knowledge.  Now, I’m not that crazy about knowledge either.  I’m more of an action oriented person.  No action taken, no value created.  Best value-adding actions come from people with great character, abilities, skills, imagination, experience, then knowledge.  So most of the time, I don’t read for knowledge.  I read with the mindset of taking action.  Therefore, I prefer to read slow and think through the ideas.  Why the author come up with this idea, what’s the line of reasoning? Under what context? Apply to what situation? Is the idea reasonable? Can I use it? How/where/when/with whom? When I read, I’m ready to note down ideas into “Short-Term To Do” list and “Long-Term Thinking” to revisit the ideas.  When the idea is a briliant idea that can be implemented immediately, I create a calendar event to take action immediately.  A few more benefits of reading I see is that it generally calms my mind, acting as a form of meditation.  I feel happier after reading and I observe that my decision making quality improves when I maintain a steady reading schedule everyday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, go off the books reading, I also read articles, watch and listen to people I admire share their ideas.  This include reading blog posts (for example of Paul Graham or especially Howard Marks), watching commencement speeches of notable universities (Harvard, Yale, MIT, Duke, etc), peer-to-peer interviews (my favorite show is The David Rubenstein’s Show by Bloomberg, Washington DC Economics Club interviews, Oxford Union interviews, or Charlie Rose interviews), or documentaries.  A lot of these activities can be done when I drive, making a net saving on time.  From my experience, a lot of the learning through this form don’t come straight into actions such as reading books, especially books on topic we care about or seeking an answer for something.  But this type of personal development goes into forming the character, enhancing and building up abilities, adjusting thinking principles, that is more beneficial into the long-run.  Put it this way, a lot of things we do everyday are influenced by higher-level way of thinking and perceiving life.  If we can learn the high-level principles of thinking and approaching life from the best thinkers, it will help in the long-run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, as online learning is liberating high quality content to average people everywhere with an internet connection.  It’s good to learn from formal and informal online courses some of the time.  I listened to Yale, NYU, and Harvard courses here and there.  I know MIT and Stanford courses are also now available mostly for free.  I also subscribe to a company called Master Class where Phil Ivey here got featured to this blog post.  For Master Class, I learned Daniel Negrenu and Phil Ivey on poker, Paul Krugman on economics, James Suckling on wine tasting.  I’m learning from David Axelrod and Karl Rove on Politics Campaigning and from Malcolm Gladwell on writing.  I want to check out briefly Stephens Curry course on Basketball not to learn the tactics and the drills but to get a feel on how this guy thinks.  I will do the same with Gary Kasparov on his Chess class.  The cost for subcription is $180/annually and considering the value of the content, this is super cheap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;(Phil Ivey on Master Class)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to learn ferrociously.  Learning never stops at school and it is best after the school - where you are matured enough to know what you want to learn about.  And you don’t have to learn to compete with anyone.  You just might want to learn to enjoy the time learning (be happy right there) and see where it leads you too.  You will also want to see what’s your capable of and when you reach there, what you’ll see next on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;

To illustrate my points, let assume we have this imaginary company and a simplified sample list of focus areas that looks like this: &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Urgent-Important-Matrix-2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24271240_121328031982477_1928903481_o-e1512030197504.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; In this sample list of focus areas, to priritize the areas, we use Urgent-Important Matrix with this legends: [First] for Urgent/Important, [Second] for Non-Urgent/Important, [Third] for Urgent/Non-Important, [Fourth] for Non-Urgent/Non-Important.  Upon seeing the Priority column, I don’t think this approach works well in this situation because:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It creates too many [Second] - in which a lot of them are very different in nature and in the ways we want to prioritize.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It doesn’t create any [Third] and [Fourth] - of course because at this high-level view where we want to manage and abstractically pay attention to some groups with large volume of works, it doesn’t make sense to have any “Non-Important” in this table.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The table includes different people take lead in different areas, followed by their vice, and sponsor.  Given the number of [Second] it creates confusion for the PIC (Person In Charge) and the vice to prioritize, and the sponsor to manage PIC’s work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of using this approach, I invented an upgrade version of prioritization based on three dimensions: &lt;strong&gt;(1) Time-Sensitive&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;(2) Survival-Sensitive&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;(3) Mattered Sensitive&lt;/strong&gt;.  In which (1) Time-Sensitive we keep Urgent/Non-Urgent.  Then I use a self-introduced factor as the second dimension, this can be anything matters to the organization, for example: Cashflow-Sensitive factor, or Strategy-Sensitive factor.  In this case, I use Survival-Sensitive, because I think Survival factor incluces the crux of what are most important in an organization, a blend between management, strategy, and finance.  A young company battle will be the survival battle.  A large company will need to defend and be paranoid about survival.  I think survival makes sense here to keep an eye on what’s really make or break the company.  Thirdly, the Important/Non-Important is replaced by Mattered/Non-Mattered.  This third dimension is more of a management reminder rather than serving as a separator between areas of focus.  Of course at this high-level view, where a line includes in itself a large group of works, nothing should stay here that is Non-Mattered.  Even though some groups of works (let say group 1) are significantly more mattered than other groups of works (group 2), but those less-mattered areas (group 2) also need to be taken care by someone.  To separate between the significance and the resources that are allocated between two different groups (1 and 2) we can simplified it by Important/Non-Important.  However, using that approach will demoralize the team who takes care of the group 2 works and hurt the culture of excellence (who want to do best for the works that are “Non-Important” to the company anyway?).  Thus I changed it to Mattered/Non-Mattered and carefully review all the focus areas to eliminate all groups that not really mattered out of the board.  So only the Mattered areas remained.  The Priority is changed to as follow: &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Urgent-Survival-Sensitive-and-Mattered.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Urgent-Survival-Sensitive-and-Mattered.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Picture1.bmp&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; We eliminates the Non-Mattered from top to bottom because:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;End-Node 2: Something that is Urgent and Survival Sensitive cannot be Non-Mattered.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;End-Node 4: Something that is Urgent and Non-Survival Sensitive and Non-Mattered may:
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Actually not worth doing anyway.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Should be re-categorized.  If it is Urgent and requires immediate resource and response, it might be Mattered.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Might apply for single task, but I don’t see a group of tasks that are Urgent, Non-Survival, and Non-Mattered altogether (we are working on a table of focus areas).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;End-Node 6: Similar to End-Node 2, something Survival Sensitive cannot be Non-Mattered.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;End-Node 8: Something that is Non-Urgent, Non-Survival, and Non-Mattered might not worth doing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the Priority legend is now changed to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Priority [First]: Urgent, Survival-Sensitive, Mattered&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Priority [Second]: Non-Urgent, Survival-Sensitive, Mattered&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Priority [Third]: Urgent, Non-Survival-Sensitive, Mattered&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Priority [Fourth] : Non-Urgent, Survival-Sensitive, Mattered&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We keep this “Mattered” even though it appears in all 4 Priority level because we want to remind both ourselves and the subodinates that the reason we do the tasks is because it’s mattered.  Regardless of how or how much mattered it is.  It matters therefore we care to design, delegate, and follow up. Upon applying this to the illustrated table above, the groups of works become: &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Urgent-Survival-Mattered.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24250865_121328035315810_481843403_o-e1512030358574.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Now, we see it won’t change the [First], because anything that is classified at Urgent/Important from the beginning will be Urgent/Survival-Sensitive/Mattered anyway.  But we see a lot of shifts from [Second] to [Fourth], one from [Second] to [Third], creating a deeper layer of priority that aids the teams better to prioritize and allocate resources. To go more details for example, we see that Expansion Strategy and Market Ingelligence Activities Design previously are both [Old Second] as Non-Urgent/Important.  But now Expansion Strategy become [New Fourth] and Market Intelligence Activities Design stay at [New Second].  That’s because the different in the Survival dimension: A company without expansion can still survive, but a company without a good design and flow of information internally and externally might make wrong business decisions and cease to exist.  Thus in the group work of “Strategy”, designing a good Market Intelligence activities is placed at higher priority comparing to thinking about expansion. We also see a lot of shifts in compliance works (HR, Legal, etc) from [Old Second: Non-Urgent/Important] to [New Fourth: Non-Urgent/Non-Survival-Sensitive/Mattered].  Compliance with the government, local and federal, is important.  But if the company doesn’t survive it doesn’t mean anything.  Doing compliance well in the cost of distration from core operating activities is also an undesirable way to prioritize workload.  Therefore with this new apporach, we see a lot of compliance, bookkeeping, and reportings activities, which are all non-urgent and important, shift to its right place of priority because it is less directly impactful to the matter of survival in the company. In here we have Feedback Management moves from [Old Second: Non-Urgent/Important] to [New Third: Urgent/Non-Survival-Sensitive/Mattered].  The reason is upon we have a complain from customer/client, even though one complain do not blow up the Earth, but we should, and we take this matter seriously, approach immediately and handle it as “crisis management”: why the customer is not happy? what can we do better next time? how should we handle the situation?  One complain does not threat the company survival (Non-Survival-Sensitive), but customer safistaction matters.  And it is Urgent because without proper management, it immediately sends a message to all other customers that they, in general, are not taken care of.  In extreme case, it can spiral into a PR crisis.  Thus it’s important to leave no unhappy customer behind and approach the complain quickly with priority. Given this is only an illustrated list, it might not show appropriate depth of priority that with all [First], [Second], [Third], and [Fourth] in a good proportion.  But I hope this idea makes sense and may it aid you in your works.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tri Ton</name></author><category term="Management" /><summary type="html">Today when I work around my focus areas dashboard and struggle with the Urgent-Important Matrix, I invented a twist into how to prioritize tasks better.  Works really well with me.

&lt;p&gt;In Middle East alone, there are many developments that have the potential magnitude of a major global impact: (1) Syria’s civil war, (2) ISIS, (3) Terrorism in Europe, (4) extreme right wing’s shift of Europe political atmosphere, (5) Syria refugee crisis, (6) US-Russia conflict in casting soft power into Middle East after Crimea crisis, (7) Conflict between Arab countries and Iran (two largest oil OPEC exporters) as a symbol of conflict between the Shittes and the Sunni in the context of historic low oil price, and (8) Economic/diplomatic conflict between Russia and Turkey.  The list above did not account for traditional conflicts and risks such as Israel-Palestine, Chinese-Indian border conflict in the East.  Outside of the Middle East, China is both increasing geo-political influence to Asia (South China Sea, Hong-Kong, Taiwan) and Africa (Zimbawe adopts Reminbi as its official currency) and dealing to its own substantial economic risk that is more and more visible and can very well be the next tipping point for a crisis at global scale that might lead to shifts in geo-politics in Asia.  North Korea declared testing H-bomb successfully (Jan 6th) that pushes conflict between this country versus South Korea and other East Asia countries to the next level.  We can add conflicts between Russia and the West as well as Brazilian economic crisis to the list as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these current global developments, what is the key development theme of the markets for 2016?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is: I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/54848606.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/54848606.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;I Don't Know&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I follow a way of thinking in which 40% believe in consistently generating alpha by superior timing and selection/allocation and 60% believe in uncertainty and randomness that Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) tries to prove.  The I-Don’t-Know school of thought is influenced by EMH, still, there are several critical implications to investors that are more practical to apply comparing to completely following EMH (such as Index Funds).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I-Don’t-Know school of thought following investors create a larger psychological room comparing to I-Know investors to accept all possibilities of the future as well as trying to not forcing their own subjective personal view into the objective developments of the market.  This creates a more relaxed and humble stand, that deals with unexpected risks better than the I-Know investors.  If I’m sure that Bank A’s cash depositing rate is 10% and Bank B’s cash depositing rate is 11%, no default as well as any other risks involved, then I will deposit 100% of my cash into Bank B.  This example represents I-Know school of thought.  Besides, there is no uncertainty in this example.  Now let’s say I have the opportunity to invest into stock of company A with expected return of 25% annually and make angel investment into a group of friends (old friends, all have PhDs) that are making space rocket to Mercury and buy the first foreign currency denominated Mongolian’s government bond, deciding how to make capital allocation depends substantially from my own subjective view about how the future would unfold.  Stock A may only achieve 5% return due to a conflict between Russia and Kazakhstan that affects company A’s business in exporting to Kazakhstan.  The group of friends who do rocket science may create a bigger rocket after 10 times of failures that now can shoot it to Jupiter instead of just Mercury.  Mongolian government may default on its obligation after the heir of Genghis Khan wins a historic election, decides to cut tie to global economy, and rebuilds their cavalry to invade North Korea.  Only with these three opportunities, I am already quite unsure on how the future will unfold needless to say about how the world will unfold next year given its complexity.  Thus, accepting to be “I-Don’t-Know” will generally make the investors wiser and avoid internal conflicts in decision making, being too hesitating or too aggressive, comparing to investors who follow I-Know school of thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, I-Don’t-Know school of thought will lead to a better risk managing practice by generally reducing sizes of each investing idea comparing to concentration as a key implication of I-Know school of thought.  By proactively accept the market as unfathomable in absolute sense, the I-Don’t-Know investors will actively develop a defensive investing mechanism to deal with extremely rare and significant risks that is inherently unavoidable from the financial markets.  Overall, these investors will neutralize betwen good years (with expected returns generally less than aggressive investors) and bad years (with expected returns generally better than aggressive investors).  However, because extremely rare and significant risks can threat to survivability, these I-Don’t-Know investors believe they will generate better long-term compounding returns based on consistency in their decision making and investing method regardless of how future unfolds.  Long-terms means 10 to 15 years and longer.  This perspective can compare Warren Buffett’s returns to Hedge Funds’ returns, it’s rare for Warren Buffett to be the best performer in the market in any given year, but within 20-30 years, it’s rare too for any Hedge Fund to generate higher compounded returns comparing to Warren’s returns in relations to their implied risks.  The reason is high achiever funds (such as funds with annual returns of 45% that result from aggressiveness would often be significantly exposed when the extremely rare and significant risks unfold, especially during crises as the case of LTCM).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returning to the question: What is the key development theme of the markets for 2016?  I think there is a great answer to that question and the answer will always be right even we change 2016 to 2026 or 2036, it is: Uncertainty.  Uncertainty is the key theme of market development that I truly feel over the years since I engaged in financial markets.  It is indeed higher every year, that strengthens my belief in investing defensively and risk managing actively will generate superior results comparing to investing aggressively.  One note, investing defensively is different to defensive investing, the former is about mindset and the later is about strategy.  Of course, there will be time the investors feel strongly about a market and there will be time the investors earn the right to be aggressive even though they follow I-Don’t-Know school of thought.  Still, the investors who follow I-Don’t-Know school of thought will always be proactive in defending against risks even though they changed from defensive mode to aggressive mode - or defensively aggressive.  That, I believe, in case the markets unfold really unexpectedly they can handle the risks that threaten their survival better and, more importantly, be more calm as they have always leave a large room in their perspective to deal with those kinds of risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We separate risk from uncertainty.  Uncertainty is measured by variance or standard deviation.  Take variance for example, variance measures the various degree of outcome (thus comes the term variance) comparing to the mean.  Outcomes involve around the mean can come in upside as well as downside.  Let’s say investors invest in the stock market with expectation to earn 7% a year is the mean, then a return of 9% of a particular year as well as a loss of -3% of another particular year are outcomes of variance.  Mean outcome does not mean that the outcome will come out as right at the mean.  Some years it will above the mean, some years it will come below the mean; but averagely all of the good and bad will average down to the mean as expected return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risk does not mean variance or standard deviation, even though traditional finance metrics often use standard deviation to measure “risk”.  Increase variance increases volatility, and in term, increase both the expected downside and the expected upside.  When an investor invest with the expected return of 7%, a return of 9% will not be considered a risk-outcome has materialized.  The investor will enjoy this upside variance, thinking herself genius.  When an investor invest with the expected return of 7% and come a return of -3%, this downside variance will be seen as a risk-outcome has materialized.  As you see, upside variance is not the risk we worry about.  If volatility comes and gives me the chance to increase my expected return of 7% to 9% year in and year out, I will be happy to increase volatility of my portfolio to the max.  The issue is, when increase volatility, we do not know what will happen among a range of probable outcomes: +9% will come? +11% will come? -8% will come? Or -3% will come?  Volatility is both your friend and foe.  Risk, or the downside volatity, is your foe alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tricky part of dealing with risk is to understand that risk is not the single final outcome that comes out in the end.  Such as in the above scenario, in one particular year, the realized return is -3%, this is a loss but not a risk.  Risk is more than that.  Risk does not black and white dictate a particular negative return.  Risk is a range of outcomes that, depends on investors, return negatively of zero or below a certain benchmark such as risk free rate or index return.  To say that to invest into Vietnam Stock Market that has the expected return of +7% and averagely of the down years, the index returned a loss of averagely -5% is underestimate the risks involved.  That does not mean when investing into Vietnam Stock Market, the investor should expect a return of 7% on normal years and a -5% of a bad year.  We will never know in advance how bad it can be and history crises are not indicative of future disasters.  Future disasters can be worse.  One prominent example of this statement is the crisis of 1997 and 2007.  To Asian people, a crisis of the magnitude of 1997 had never been perceived to these young nations (Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Korea, Russia post Soviet era).  To the US, a crisis of 2007 is of magnitude of 1929 crash.  I don’t believe anyone who is active in the market in 2007 have experience live what happened during 1929-1936.  Even Warren Buffett and George Soros were both born after that (1930).  So what happened during 1997 and 2007 were so new, so strange, and so novel to everybody.  Thinking back on some of the major economic events, we will come to same conclusion: Black Monday 1987 market crash is the largest one day drop in percentage of DJIA – very novel, 2010 flash crash is another unusual risk-outcome that came alive – very novel and unprecedent in finance history, oil spikes during 1973 crisis resemble the oil price spike in 1861 in the United States – but again, noone experience both 1861 oil crisis and 1973 oil crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Flash-Crash-Chart.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Flash-Crash-Chart.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How frequently these rare events, much worse than expectation comes around?  Post World War II, we have Nixon Shock (1971) that led to US Dollar near crash (to date, it is the single event that led to nearly rejection of USD as the global currency, established after Bretton Woods in 1944), Oil Crisis of 1973, 1980 Latin debt crisis, 1987 market crash (world-wide, not only DJIA), 1990 Japan Stock/Estate Bubble burst (still on a prolonged loss-era after 20 years now in Japan), 1997 Asia Financial Crisis, 2001 Tech Bubble, 2008 Mortgage Crisis.  Except a peaceful period from 1945 to pre-1970, we have 8 major global financial crises during the last 40 years.  Now we should really start to question how frequently these rare events happen.  My most plain and unsophisticated conclusion is that these rare things do come around so frequently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s return back to 2005 and think of what is the probability of an event with the magnitude of 2007-2008 crisis to happen?  The truth is on Wall Street there were a significant underestimate of risk in quant models among large banks and hedge funds.  A magnitude of 2007-2008 is unprecedent to anyone who were participating in the market at that time, thus, noone ran a model with worst case outcomes that bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Capture.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Capture.png&quot; alt=&quot;Risk and Rare Events&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this era of new complex geo-political delopments in the most recent years, I remind myself as a practitioner in the financial market that not to count too high on anything and to keep my mind open to any possibility.  We don’t know what outcome will unfold among all possibilities and magnitude of bad case of scenarios are often underestimated: it can be worse than any bad experience ever perceived and worse than the worst case scenarios.  Extremely bad rare cases do come around even though the probability for such event is low.  Investors should be invest very cautiously all the time and try their best to understand what risks involved.  As the old saying goes, it’s fatal not to know what you are doing and as you don’t see the risk ahead, it does not mean there is no risk at all.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tri Ton</name></author><category term="Financial Crisis" /><category term="Global Macro" /><category term="Investment Principles" /><category term="Risk Management" /><summary type="html">Risk does not necessarily mean it will happen.  It means it has the probability to happen as a range of outcomes.  Because among those outcomes only one will materialize, people often forget and/or underestimate what might happen.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">What is the most important thing to an investor?</title><link href="https://www.huetri.com/2015/12/03/what-is-the-most-important-thing-to-an-investor/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="What is the most important thing to an investor?" /><published>2015-12-03T18:14:02+07:00</published><updated>2015-12-03T18:14:02+07:00</updated><id>https://www.huetri.com/2015/12/03/what-is-the-most-important-thing-to-an-investor</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.huetri.com/2015/12/03/what-is-the-most-important-thing-to-an-investor/">&lt;p&gt;In life, sometimes we go through a series of periods between lack information and too much information, thus our perspective and thinking are not correctly formed and clear to answer important questions.  When I started to work at Vietnam Investments Group (VIG), when joining any deals, we research everything possible about the market, competitors, changes in industrial structure, etc.  Results of those studies are a series of information about everything we think we can possibly have, including public information and private information.  I typically end up having a lot of information but not knowing how to arrange and prioritize them correctly.  Deciding to invest or not is a difficult matter and there are many dimensions to consider back and forth.  Market position? High net asset value over low valuation? strong management team with 20 years of experience and had engaging into the business 5 years? What are the key factors to decide to go or kill a deal?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is, again, is a complex matter, however in this article I provide a facet that has a tremendous influence to the investment process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what is the most important thing to an investor?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I coincidentally come up a similar question that open my mind in finding what is the most important thing: What is the most important thing to a salesman?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In business, I feel that businessmen have to create jobs, pay government budgets, be leaders, solve social issues (and success will follow).  In investment, I feel that investors have to see the big picture, invest into the right teams and right projects (at the right time), push the world to the next edge (such as investing into Facebook and Google), and consult to investee management.  On the contrary, the sales perspective is very clear-cut: You sell the product, or you don’t, period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the most important thing to a salesman? - Successfully sell the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what is the most important thing to an investor? - Optimize returns over acceptable risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two dimensions: (1) optimized returns in the relationship to (2) the level of risks absorbed with that particular investment channel/strategy.  Previously when thinking about this matter, I only think about returns.  The more time flies by (with additional painful experience) the more I understand risk management is a natural counter-part with optimizing returns.  To the very end, my view about investment is establishing a sound investment strategy and optimize risk management.  The last perspective is more active on risk management rather than active on finding the next killing opportunity.  If the investment process is sound, it will automatically generate profit, then I will be conservative and preserve previous capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When looking at an investor under this perspective, I have a more matured view about different investment classes.  Previous, I think Private Equity (PE) and Venture Capital (VC) are more cool comparing to bond fund and pension fund.  The key reason is when I work on PE and VC I have the feeling to join into projects that can change the industry, economy, and create something completely novel and push the world to the next edge.  That’s certainly interesting, however, even the institutional investors or sovereign funds when they invest into PE or VC firms they want the fund managers to answer the most important question to an investor: will the fund optimize returns over the risks absorbed?  Else, changing the world is not too much of a matter.  Under the global investor perspective, they pay attention to optimizing the capital they are managing.  If the world is shaking, possibly they will quickly forget high-tech companies that are bringing humanity to Mars (such as SpaceX of Elon Musk) and allocate capital into governmental bonds of major countries.  If the world is prosperous, they may sell bonds and invest into PE or VC in emerging markets.  If fiat assets seem particularly challenging, maybe they will strengthen their positions into gold and real estate.  Under the global investor perspective, companies, countries, precious metal, houses, paintings are asset classes for them to optimally utilize their capital under different investment environments.  It will certainly be illogical to think that these global investors would invest into a PE or VC that the firm itself doesn’t utilize those capital to achieve the global investors perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is the performance of certain asset classes and major funds in the world during 2001-2014 period that my associate has studied when we had conversations about different assets classes with different investment strategies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Capture.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Capture-1024x230.png&quot; alt=&quot;Market Performance 2001-2014&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I stick with things that are not important to an investor (such as cool or changing the world) maybe it will be difficult for me to accept the performance of VC in the past 15 years have only been about 2.76% annually.  That would be lower than performance of pension funds that index their portfolio to Dow Jones composition (4.97%) or S&amp;amp;P composition (7.07%).  Actually both VC and start-up (two close but different industries) distribute their returns in a very skewed manner comparing to normal distribution, in which there are a few VC and start-ups have a major returns and most go into losses or bankruptcy (hit-driven characteristic).  Besides, VC can decide if they want to public their records (self reporting bias), leading to evaluate performance of this asset class is somewhat incomplete, adding to further barriers such as providing self reported interim valuation of portfolio (before sell off the investee or calling the next round of capital) or only the winning funds provide the records (survival bias).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Return to due diligence issue so that we (VIG) try to decide if we invest or not, under optimally utilize capital perspective, we will consider thoroughly the upsides and the downsides.  Overall, when investing into a listed or a private company, it is similar that the investors have to have certain clues on how the cash will flow back to the investors.  There are generally two ways, the first is dividend, the second is capital appreciation (sell the stock).  Thus, before engaging into a deal, an intelligent investor has to think about how she will sell that company (IPO or trade sales, to whom?) with what kind of valuations under scenarios.  For example, if during the due diligence process the investors see a potential company with strong management team but also see an unclear vision on how to divest the company (for example in the next 5 years, this industry might come to saturation phrase with many similar companies go into bankruptcy due to a massive over-supply, and the remaining companies have to liquidate or sell itself cheaply), the fund will be clearly cautious.  Under this view, the investee is a “product” and the fund is “salesman”.  What is the most important thing to a salesman? Should the investor invest if later on the “salesman” cannot sell its “product”? Or sell with a loss?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, to evaluate a deal in line with investors’ thinking, first thing to consider is how would the deal return? how would the risk unfold? Not about market position of the investee or CEO’s experience.  After identify factors that can answer those first two questions, the investors go deep into those factors and further analyze them: where superior returns come from? is it a good company? and are there clear exit routes?  Then further into deeper layers to identify company’s valuation, what formed that valuation, and how the fund can add value to maximize factors that enhance the investee valuation and protect against the investee weaknesses after the investment is made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the cut-out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUZ4OqSHovc[/embed]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hand started at last level of Day 5 with blinds &amp;amp; ante of 20,000/40,000/5,000, Fedor had 2.8M (70BB) in Mid Position while De Silva had 1.8M (45BB) in the Big Blinds.  Pot pre-open was 100,000 8-handed.  &lt;strong&gt;Fedor opened &lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/8s.gif&quot; alt=&quot;8s&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/7s.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/7s.gif&quot; alt=&quot;7s&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 90,000 [2.25x BB]&lt;/strong&gt;, folded around to &lt;strong&gt;De Silva with &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ah.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ah.gif&quot; alt=&quot;ah&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/kc.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/kc.gif&quot; alt=&quot;kc&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 3-Bet to 265,000&lt;/strong&gt;.  Holz called.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/8s.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pot was 590,000, making Stack-to-Ratio Ratio of De Silva to 3x and Holz to 4.3x.  At this small Stack-to-Pot Ratio, this hand can be a decisive hand of the tournament of both player for the final table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flop came &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/8h.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/8h.gif&quot; alt=&quot;8h&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jd.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jd.gif&quot; alt=&quot;jd&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/da.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/da.gif&quot; alt=&quot;da&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; gave De Silva top pair top kicker and Holz bottom pair.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a very good flop for De Silva as it hits De Silva range pretty hard.  If De Silva 3-bet for value, he is likely to have  &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ax.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ax.gif&quot; alt=&quot;ax&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/kx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;kx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ax.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ax.gif&quot; alt=&quot;ax&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;qx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suited, and pairs of &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;jx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;jx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;+.  Of course he can have bluff with two cards to the bottom range such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/10s.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/10s.gif&quot; alt=&quot;10s&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/4s.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/4s.gif&quot; alt=&quot;4s&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  But at this stage of the tournament (approaching final table bubble) and this featured table, I think the 3-Bet bluff range of De Silva is likely to be thin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, the flop has the potential to evolve ugly for &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ah.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ah.gif&quot; alt=&quot;ah&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/kc.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/kc.gif&quot; alt=&quot;kc&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  Any diamond makes the potential flush, any &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/kx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/kx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;kx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;qx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/10x.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/10x.gif&quot; alt=&quot;10x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; make the potential broadway straight or two-pair, any &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/9x.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/9x.gif&quot; alt=&quot;9x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/7x.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/7x.gif&quot; alt=&quot;7x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; potentially make potential &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;jx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;-high straight, any &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;jx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can improve middle pair into trips.  Given Fedor wide 3-Bet calling range, he can have anything that either benefits from any cards mentioned above or use those card to build a pot that De Silva might be unhappy to put his tournament on the line with top pair top kicker.  At this point, Fedor can have anything that hit that board too.  Possibly a top pair weaker kicker such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ax.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ax.gif&quot; alt=&quot;ax&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;qx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suited (likely) or middle pair such as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;qx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;jx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suited (likely), to two pair &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ax.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ax.gif&quot; alt=&quot;ax&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;jx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suited (also likely), gut-shot broadway draw &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/kx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/kx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;kx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;qx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (likely), to the less likely such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;qx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/10x.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/10x.gif&quot; alt=&quot;10x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suited that makes double gut-shot straight draw and of course bottom pair with &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/8x.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/8x.gif&quot; alt=&quot;8x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (actually the most less likely).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;De Silva’s continuous bet on the flop is a standard follow-up.  If he had made a 3-Bet bluff with the bottom of his range, Flop bet is a must.  If he had &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ax.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ax.gif&quot; alt=&quot;ax&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, he wants to make value from weaker  &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ax.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ax.gif&quot; alt=&quot;ax&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and protect his hand against this draw heavy board.  Moreover, De Silva is out of position in this hand that makes a flop bet is even more neccessary as he wants to have initiative to balance against a worse position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flop: De Silva bet 345,000 into 590,000 pot&lt;/strong&gt;, a standard 2/3 pot bet and &lt;strong&gt;Fedor called&lt;/strong&gt;.  Pot 1,280,000, De Silva had 1.1M behind and Fedor had 2.2M behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at this flop, I don’t ever think Fedor was to fold even he only had bottom pair.  A guy who called 3-Bet preflop with &lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/8s.gif&quot; alt=&quot;8s&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/7s.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/7s.gif&quot; alt=&quot;7s&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is not going to fold with a piece on the flop.  If De Silva made 3-Bet bluff with trash hands, float here and bet the turn would take it.  If De Silva indeed had a hand (more likely), making a call here, Fedor knew he has to win this hand from making play and his bottom pair has virtually no show-down value if De Silva either barrel or check/call the Turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point if we put De Silva to &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot;

&lt;p&gt;This card is a scare-card to both of the player.  But it is much more scary to De Silva than to Fedor.  Because only two hands of De Silva’s range can be improved with this &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qh.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qh.gif&quot; alt=&quot;qh&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ax.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ax.gif&quot; alt=&quot;ax&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;qx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (now making two-pair) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;qx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;qx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (now making middle set).  But to De Silva, this &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qh.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qh.gif&quot; alt=&quot;qh&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; hit a lot of Fedor’s range: Fedor is very likely to have &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ax.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ax.gif&quot; alt=&quot;ax&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;qx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; too for made two-pair and now middle pair improved to two-pair such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;qx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;jx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  If we run equity calculation with this &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qh.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qh.gif&quot; alt=&quot;qh&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to the above range of two player, keeping De Silva bluff range, Fedor is now ahead 69%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a critical point into this match when this card come: De Silva has to act first.  Because De Silva has to act first, he will reveal how he feel about this turn card.  If he indeed make two-pair with &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ax.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ax.gif&quot; alt=&quot;ax&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;qx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, he HAS to protect his hand here and now: the board is getting so ugly for straight and flush combo draw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This actually shows a very common difficult spot in poker: you have a strong hand in a bad position and tough spot arise. &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;jx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;jx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;qx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;qx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ax.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ax.gif&quot; alt=&quot;ax&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/kx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/kx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;kx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ax.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ax.gif&quot; alt=&quot;ax&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;qx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; open raise early position or 3-Bet early positions should be expected to face difficulties here and there with high reverse implied odd either with bad board developments or opponent’s aggressiveness or both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turn: De Silva checked the Turn.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right here I think the hand would be come interesting because a check here was what Fedor had been waiting for.  De Silva was facing a very difficult decision in the Turn.  2nd barrel bet into &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qh.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qh.gif&quot; alt=&quot;qh&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; effectively turns  &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ah.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ah.gif&quot; alt=&quot;ah&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/kc.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/kc.gif&quot; alt=&quot;kc&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; into a bluff.  Because betting here De Silva is representing at least two-pair to set. There are only one two-pair is possible for this board: &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ac.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ac.gif&quot; alt=&quot;ac&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qc.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qc.gif&quot; alt=&quot;qc&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/as.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/as.gif&quot; alt=&quot;as&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qs.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qs.gif&quot; alt=&quot;qs&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, there are also only three sets possible for De Silva: &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ax.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ax.gif&quot; alt=&quot;ax&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ax.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ax.gif&quot; alt=&quot;ax&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;qx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;qx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;jx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;jx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  Logically, any two-pair or set either have to make a 2nd barrel here on the Turn or going for a check/raise to protect his hand from flush and straight draw.  The only made-straight on this board at this spot is &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/kx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/kx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;kx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/10x.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/10x.gif&quot; alt=&quot;10x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (must be suited) which is possible but far less likely than other two-pair type hands.  And if De Silva bet his set and two pair here and run into this gut-shot straight with &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/kx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/kx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;kx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/10x.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/10x.gif&quot; alt=&quot;10x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shove.  So be it.  This check partly open De Silva hand face up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;He is done with his bluff pre-flop and continuous bet flop.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;He pot control with strong hand has show-down value: &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ax.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ax.gif&quot; alt=&quot;ax&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/kx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/kx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;kx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/kx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/kx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;kx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/kx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/kx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;kx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;He is going to check/shove with set and two pair.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This option is far more less likely, as if Fedor check back, a free card here is definitely a disaster if a diamond, &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/kx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/kx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;kx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/10x.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/10x.gif&quot; alt=&quot;10x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/9x.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/9x.gif&quot; alt=&quot;9x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;jx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; come.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, Fedor definitely has to bet.  And he can bet with any two cards:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;End De Silva bluff.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Test if De Silva actually have a hand and maybe depends on the River to bluff him out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fedor bet 425,000 into 1,280,000 pot.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This bet about 1/3 size of the pot and give De Silva 4-to-1 (20% pot odd) to call.  When Fedor bet this on Turn, he is not likely to give up on River unless the River come a completely blank such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2c.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2c.gif&quot; alt=&quot;2c&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  Of course he can win on spot if De Silva bluff.  If De Silva call then this is a preparation for a river all-in.  As Fedor knows he has to tell a story here and once bluff is generally not enough to push De Silva off his hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;De Silva called for 425,000.  The Pot then was 2,130,000.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Upeshka_De_Silva.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Upeshka_De_Silva.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Upeshka_De_Silva&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Picture: De Silva called the Turn, courtersy: Pokerlistings.com)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norman Chad make an excellent comments here: “… and a check/raise is certainly on his [De Silva] arsenal”.  I think if De Silva opt to a check/raise here, he then reprensented top two-pair or better to protect his hand against draws.  Facing this move, Fedor is likely to fold everything but set &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;jx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;jx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/8x.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/8x.gif&quot; alt=&quot;8x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/8x.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/8x.gif&quot; alt=&quot;8x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; because Silva range is now too strong.  Noted here De Silva knows that he had the &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ah.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ah.gif&quot; alt=&quot;ah&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that blocks many of Fedor heart-flush draw and heart straight and flush combo draw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By making this call here, De Silva halfly open-up the remaining of his hand:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;He is not having a bluff here.  So his range will be: &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;jx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;jx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;+, &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ax.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ax.gif&quot; alt=&quot;ax&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;qx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ax.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ax.gif&quot; alt=&quot;ax&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/kx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/kx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;kx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;He is not having two-pair, set, and above here, making he had exactly &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ax.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ax.gif&quot; alt=&quot;ax&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/kx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/kx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;kx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By calling here, De Silva make a major cap on his range.  He had a show-down value that the only hand fail nicely into that category is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ax.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ax.gif&quot; alt=&quot;ax&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/kx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/kx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;kx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; because &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/kx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/kx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;kx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/kx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/kx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;kx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was then so weak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fedor then had all of the information he needed.  A nice River card would be what he waited for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;River came &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/9d.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/9d.gif&quot; alt=&quot;9d&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When watched this video and when this card felt off, I thought: “Shove!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/9d.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/9d.gif&quot; alt=&quot;9d&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;arrival makes flop flush and straight possible and is so ugly (in view of De Silva) that now if we eliminated all of bluff range of De Silva out and he has: &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;jx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;jx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;+, &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ax.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ax.gif&quot; alt=&quot;ax&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;qx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suited, &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ax.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ax.gif&quot; alt=&quot;ax&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/kx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/kx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;kx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; vs Fedor’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/8x.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/8x.gif&quot; alt=&quot;8x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/8x.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/8x.gif&quot; alt=&quot;8x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;jx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;jx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ax.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ax.gif&quot; alt=&quot;ax&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;qx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suited and &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ax.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ax.gif&quot; alt=&quot;ax&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;jx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suited, &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/kx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/kx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;kx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;qx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/8x.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/8x.gif&quot; alt=&quot;8x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/7x.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/7x.gif&quot; alt=&quot;7x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suited to &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;qx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;jx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suited (keep the whole range of Fedor preflop), Fedor would then be ahead about 63%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;River: De Silva checked and Fedor moved all-in, bet 765,000 into 2,130,000 pot.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giving De Silva pot odd of 3.8-to-1 or about 20%.  De Silva will need to be right 20% to call this river bet and vs Fedor’s range, De Silva is having 37% equity.  But real life doesn’t repeat this situation 1 million times for the probability to reach the long-run.  De Silva is having his tournament (near the final table) on the line and he badly needs to be right this time and only this time counts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How it turned out in the end? De Silva tanked for 10 minutes, Daniel Negreanu called the clock, the floor man came and made the count-down, and finally &lt;strong&gt;De Silva made the right tough call and double up&lt;/strong&gt;.  That is a pretty sick call.  Fedor was down to a short-stack again with only 1M in chip (25BB) to follow up to Day 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After the hand and discussions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of debates on if this is a good call or a bad call of De Silva.  But there is nothing I doubt about how good Fedor played this hand.  What an excellent way of playing a hand!  Given De Silva correctly call this River all-in, there might be leaks somewhere that make the story is not convincing enough for De Silva to unconciously insta-fold the hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I come up with two major explanations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First is Fedor range is too thin when he shove the river.  Let’s re-look at his 3-Bet calling range preflop:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Middle pair: &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/8x.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/8x.gif&quot; alt=&quot;8x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/8x.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/8x.gif&quot; alt=&quot;8x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;jx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;jx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What in this range would call the Flop 2/3 pot bet, bet the 1/3 pot Turn, and shove 1/3 pot River with?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Group A - Let’s look at the not likely hands:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Middle pair turn Set:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/8x.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/8x.gif&quot; alt=&quot;8x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/8x.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/8x.gif&quot; alt=&quot;8x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;jx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;jx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Would have to bet 2/3 pot Turn to all-in the Turn for getting value from &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ax.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ax.gif&quot; alt=&quot;ax&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;qx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and protect against &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ah.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ah.gif&quot; alt=&quot;ah&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/kh.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/kh.gif&quot; alt=&quot;kh&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Middle pair turn river Straight:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/10x.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/10x.gif&quot; alt=&quot;10x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/10x.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/10x.gif&quot; alt=&quot;10x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: I don’t think Fedor bet &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/10x.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/10x.gif&quot; alt=&quot;10x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/10x.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/10x.gif&quot; alt=&quot;10x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the Turn because a bet here inflate the pot meanwhile &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/10x.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/10x.gif&quot; alt=&quot;10x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/10x.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/10x.gif&quot; alt=&quot;10x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has show-down value and a straight draw.  He is more likely to check back.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Suited connector:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;qx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;jx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suited and &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/9x.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/9x.gif&quot; alt=&quot;9x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/8x.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/8x.gif&quot; alt=&quot;8x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;s: Less likely to shove river because the risk of De Silva two-pair with &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ax.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ax.gif&quot; alt=&quot;ax&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;qx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is still a possibility.  These two hands on that board are more of a show-down value hands.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ace high:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Same with &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;qx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;jx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suited - &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ax.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ax.gif&quot; alt=&quot;ax&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;qx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ax.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ax.gif&quot; alt=&quot;ax&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;jx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is likely to check back the River because on this board two-pair is likely to have only show-down value.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Group B - Likely hands:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Value:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/9x.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/9x.gif&quot; alt=&quot;9x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/9x.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/9x.gif&quot; alt=&quot;9x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Float on Flop and bluff Turn with a gut-shot is reasonable, because on Turn this hand is so weak to expect to win a show-down.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;jx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/10x.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/10x.gif&quot; alt=&quot;10x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suited: Float on flop and bet Turn with gut-shot fits too.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bluff:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/kx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/kx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;kx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/qx.gif&quot; alt=&quot;qx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/8x.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/8x.gif&quot; alt=&quot;8x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/7x.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/7x.gif&quot; alt=&quot;7x&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suited&lt;/li&gt;

But if he checked the Turn, the River shove might be even more difficult to push De Silva off his hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second explaination is the pot odd offered.  River shove only about 3.8-to-1 to call in De Silva perspective, and indeed because De Silva is so short that it is about 20% of the final pot size.  Make this call is quite mandatory in cash game situation (with the same odd).  If both De Silva and Fedor are deep (either in cash game or tournament) such as 100-150+ big blinds, a river shove here is a real stress test.  Indeed it is an insta-fold to me if this is a deep stack river overbet shove, unless I have a strong logic for this is a bluff from meta-game information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other explainations can be taken into accounts are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If De Silva win this hand, he will have about 90+BB and it is a great shape for the final table.  Why not risking the remaining 20BB for a final table shot?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fedor had been so aggressive, increasing the likelihood that he is bluffing.  Thus might widen calling range of De Silva.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, this is an amazing hand that I like it very much.  Executed by two very talented players.  More information about this hand can be found below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take Ventures Capital.  A VC with USD 50M goes all around across countries and regions, see through 5,000-10,000 ideas within its first 4 years before settling with a portfolio of around 25-50 investees.  Per 10 deals, hopefully one will hit big.  3 break-evens.  The rest will likely to go out of business.  Except exceptional performance in 1999 (dot-com bubble), VC averagely only returns 7.8% IRR across a time span from 2003 to 2013 (Forbes).  Except a few exceptional names such as Sequoia and Y Combinator, VC itself skewed to a few winners and a pool of broken records.  For the investees, we are taking about 5,000 to 10,000 ideas and teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take Private Equity.  PE goes for businesses that have already pass survival stage and went into mid-market.  PE with USD 100M may hold a portfolio of 10-20 investees after looking into more than 1,000 mid-size business models.  Per 10 deals, hopefully 5 makes 5x+ Cash-on-Cash returns, 3 break-evens, and 2 downs.  For the investees, we are talking about 5-10 years into operation, market position of top 3, and management with 10+ years of experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both VC and PE are comprised by a team of experienced and high-caliber professionals, see through thousands of ideas, have wide market connections, and collect data across the economies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning with excessive dedication and strong attitude&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a myth that lazy people get more things done in shorter time so that they can stay idle.  Life teaches me that to make a difference, you go to the max of your productivity, squeeze it with continuously improving efficiency and discruptive productivity hacks, then work harder than everyone else.  By this, you create an edge by two dimensions: you work way smarter and you work more.  And this is the work’s interest rate with compounding power: time goes side by side with your mastery.  Let’s get it straight: you cannot climb Everest in leisure time with a few days of preparation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three dominant themes that we shared at VI Group for young and ambitious professionals are: smart, hard working, and willing to learn.  You’ll see only smart is the pre-requisite, hard working and willing to learn are the effort put forth and go hand in hand.  More to note, smart is a commodity that, in today’s environment, is priced cheaply.  The equation itself becomes: excessive dedication, and strong attitude.  Education may be stopped at university, especially for industries where practical experiences are more valued.  However, learning doesn’t stop at university and indeed doesn’t count much there also.  One of the first awkward moments in my professional life is that my university transcript has never been read.  From Day One of my university life I have studied hard and graduated with a prominent position.  But it never payoffs the way I initially expected it to be: by making an advantage on job applying.  Weird enough, from Day One of founding my company, NTS Partners, I have also never looked into university transcript from any of my team members.  Maybe adaptability, coping with new problems, and dealing with off-the-book issues are where the value stored.  That’s why looking into this perspective, strong attitude team members with excessive dedication is valueable: they have a ground and an engine for the learning process that continuosly takes place that makes their “value” appreciates as time goes by instead of being depreciated by reducing agility and youth-ambition as age and family catch by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time as life’s currency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major part of my learning experience involves with being sensitive with time.  Time is life’s currency and involuntarily continuous spending is the way it is designed that truly.make.every.second.counts.  Time dimension can change a lot of core life perspectives and change the whole idea of learning all-around.  Coming back to the statement above on lazy person, the myth goes as lazy person, in order to avoid doing work, would find a smarter way to do things and it saves time.  However, the mental lazy person doesn’t mean to go any where far and create anything substantial that’s why let’s through him away.  Still, the idea is valid: before working harder, work smarter.  And not only work just marginally smarter, find hacks and discruptive ways of doing things that save substantial time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s press forward with failure: failure is inevitable but the core thing to deal with failure is to standing up and continue fighting, not to learn from mistakes.  Of course we learn from mistakes but mistakes don’t teach us much besides avoid repeating old mistakes.  Indeed, human kind is built around what works, rather than improving from failures.  The process is: you do it, fail, you do it again differently, fail, and you do it again differently, it somewhat works, then you press on what works and marginally improves on what works.  One day, critical mass hits around what works and you have a transformational result.  The idea is the early you find things that works the more time you save, because learning from what works is more valuable than learning from what doesn’t work.  It’s like mining a gold mine: going around where doesn’t have gold doesn’t get you anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, time forces me to think critically on what matters.  Such as family is the best thing that has ever happened to my life and what my company is trying to achieve is what gets me wake up excitingly every single morning.  Everything else becomes lower in priority.  It is so simple but so striking that defending the line that I draw on the sand can be both so rewarding and difficult.  Life is so tempting and pull you in all directions.  Knowing which way to go is a difficult personal quest and focus on going on the journey requires sacrifices because time is the rarest resource and need to be particularly well managed.  Learning to live a simpler and deeper lifestyle is one of my awaking experience.  Throwing off non-matter things, making less decisions but try making each of the decision lasts as long as possible (so you don’t spend time remaking that decision), creating less and more concentrated solutions are my notable learning experience along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practicing Reflection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how to develop a life-long learning habit?  The brain needs reenforcements to take ideas from the air to its short-term memory side (that will fade away quickly), and then to long-term memory side.  Therefore in order to make learning counts, bad news is we have to repeat learning the same lessons over again to make sure it stays neatly in the brain.  Most (maybe up to 80% of more) of what we expose today is forgotten tomorrow as the brain can only recall in details of what just happen within 24 hours in its short-term side of the memory.  Good news is our lives are way leaner by forgetting things, but bad news is if you don’t force yourself to learn everyday, most of what you learn today will be forgotten damn quickly.  Therefore, I set aside 5 minutes everyday to just breath and rethink about what happened, what I screw up, what should I do better, and what I want to put into my brain and carry forward.  I note down the ideas in a notebook, everyday (someday you’ll realize you learn pretty much of nothing, but that’s fine), and call it Daily Reflection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But daily reminding is not enough for the brain to put things from short-term memory to long-term memory.  Weekly enforcement is needed to continue bridging between the two types of memories.  On every Saturday morning, before working, I spend 15 minutes to go through the calendar and task lists of what I have done the past week, who I met, what damage that I created, and think on what should I do better, and what I want to carry from my Daily Reflection to Weekly level.  I note down the Weekly Reflection list into my notebook.  Writing is a great way to reenforce at the next level and truly catch the ideas down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every last Saturday of the month, I’ll go through the calendar of the past month and my Reflection notes, thinking on what lessons I continue to dig deeper on Monthly level.  Note it down and call it Monthly Reflection.  Monthly Reflection sometimes takes me up to one hour in private contemplation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, every year big learning event waiting at Yearly level: Yearly Reflection.  It will be impossible to go through task level on yearly level as I have thousands of them.  But calendar is possible.  I’ll go through major achievements and failures within the year, review all wounds and scars, re-read all notes from the past year and making some policies for changes in the next year.  It is great to plan for the next year from this point also.  Normal time for Yearly Reflection is at least 3 hours in private contemplation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Reflection-Table.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://huetri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Reflection-Table.png&quot; alt=&quot;Reflection Table&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This system is easy to set up but need discipline to make it a habit.  It works well for me since 2012, through sometimes life is too hectic to keep all things staight and continuous, but just go back and cover the missing time.  Don’t give up on building yourself what you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in short, what is my biggest lesson for 2014?  It is: Let’s cut the craps and get into the essentials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did it feel like when I decide to leave VI Group, a notable private equity house in Vietnam, to run my own start-up ventures on the end of raining November season of 2013?  After all of the exciting feelings of walking life my own way, I feel scary.  So scary that I felt it in the air on every breath I took.  I saw the color of it.  I saw how the future turns out if everything falls apart.  I was on a special situation where I don’t have any time to waste.  And this 3 years counting from November 2013 will dictate where my life will go in the next 20 years.  So I feel like I have no room for mistake.  The feeling was like jumping off a high cliff in a stormy sky.  The house’s protection had expired and, from then on, I need to flap my wings without any guidance.  Employer’s brand is a thing of the past, now strength is the proof of my existence.  On retrospect, I feel the amount of uncertainty I had to deal with was massive.  Here and there are deals my partners and I hadn’t finished structuring it yet.  There was a really big deal we were working together; however, we don’t know how the deal would be in the end.  The visions were divert everywhere as we didn’t have enough minimum information to see it the same thing.  There was another deal we messed it up altogether, and after months of running the deal went nowhere.  I was there, all alone, on the final meetings with our counter party, cleaned up all of the shits we created, took the blame and wished our counter party the best for their endeavor.  There was another time everything was really exciting.  We had golf session on 6-stars luxury resort on an island that was larger than Singapore.  We tried to arrange the trip from Ho Chi Minh City to that place by helicopter (finally we could not get the flight route permit).  Then we played with a top Vietnam golfer and powerful businessmen.  Afterward were fine dining, fine dining on every meeting.  We talked about energy visions, large M&amp;amp;A plans, foreign countries business opportunities, recovery of Vietnam stock market (when VNIndex was something like 420-440 points), the markets of North Europe, North Asia, and North America.  Months later my oversea partner notified the team on counter party betrayal and disappearance which costed him a few millions dollars.  If there is something to mark my life this period, and possibly in the next at least 5 years, it will be what I call “a massive amount of uncertainty”.  Fortunately enough, I love uncertainty and love to ride my wings amid the clouds.  So I embrace it.  That’s how we have my 4th lesson of my 25: Dealing with uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Categories:  Life Time of realization:  Early 2014 On Ventures:  Board Member of Cloudjet Solutions, CEO of NTS Partners&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding uncertainty and risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uncertainty is not risk.  Many understand uncertainty only a half of it.  Uncertainty is the variance.  Variance itself is not risk, too.  Variance has two side: upside and downside.  Upside uncertainty is what makes Facebook Facebook and makes Flappy Bird Flappy Bird.  Downside uncertainty is the “true risk” and what makes millions of apps have never hit like Snap Chat or get a hit that is enough for their survival.  Therefore, the good news is, on the baseline, to deal with uncertainty we have 50% chance of being favor.  Of course, not all uncertainty comes to us are on the baseline.  Some battles we have to fight it up-hill, but let’s not forget we have a baseline of 50% upside uncertainty on our side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risk, on the other hand, is what we really scare of.  As my learned-it-the-hard-way experience of once being broke and constantly being tested of survival: protecting capital is more important that expanding capital, defense is more important than offense.  Riding the offense is a sophisticated matter.  Two similar businesses may get hit on the same ground, but being led by two different entrepreneurs may lead to notably difference final results.  For example MySpace and Facebook, they do quite the same thing, MySpace is a hit too on early Social Network era but MySpace’s hit was never like Facebook’s hit.  Facebook knows how to lead the upside uncertainty well over MySpace.  On the same token, on a rising stock market, most people made money like what I saw on 2006-2008 period on Vietnam’s stock market.  From the average house-keeper to top-notch investors, still, top-notch investors were likely to know what to do on that environment and made more on the upside.  However, nobody gets broke by making money, and if you don’t make it to the top of the upside, getting the hit is enough to open a firework party.  On the other hand, handling downside uncertainty – or risk – is what makes the outstanders outstanding.  In business and gambling industry alike, many rise and fall on a blink.  To make success lasts, handling the downfall is crucial, and it’s better to outperform in bad time rather than in good time.  The reason is simple: on bad time it threats our survival, on good time it’s just about who get more fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The entrepreneurial spirit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entrepreneurs’ spirit to deal with uncertainty (both upside and downside) should be placed at the paramount.  Investors face a lot of downside uncertainty too.  On each investee, they face business risk, financial risk, key man risk, execution risk, and leadership risk.  On the whole portfolio, they face macro risk and systematic risk.  Each of the risks are prominent.  Through deals flowed through my hand and deals I observed, I have clear cases for each of the micro-risk listed above.  Once a micro-risk sparks, other micro risks follow; such as when good time everybody is happy, when financial risk strikes the company, there is likely to have key man risk to follow and lead to execution risk.  Each of the case is a huge headache.  For macro risks, we have Thailand Crisis in 1997, Global Financial Crisis 2009 that put thousands of companies to bankruptcy and millions to be unemployed on the scary same moment.  To an investor, her track record is critical, when the first fund blows up, it is incredibly hard to raise the second fund.  However, investor’s business cycle is typically longer than entrepreneur’s business cycle.  For example a VC/PE investor may have a fund life for 10 years with an addition extension for 2 years on the final exit.  Home-run win can still happen at the last minutes.  Overall, a VC may have a portfolio of 50 companies and one of it hits really big may already make the fund extremely successful.  This is because a fund has many deals and the deals protect each other.  On the other hand, entrepreneurs’ business cycle is shorter, typically 1-2 years toward the first investment round and a total of 5-6 years toward the first hit.  Past that horizon, it’s maybe better to work on the next idea.  Besides, entrepreneurs focus on a single business, so effectively they put all eggs into one basket.  The downside uncertainty is then very concentrated and makes the feel very heavy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the key to deal with uncertainty?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key is to believe we can do it, ride the upside and deal the downside.  It was like if we come across a seemingly unbreakable puzzle, when we know the puzzle can be solved, we already go half of the rough way.  Yet we seem to lose the ability to deal with uncertainty during the time we grow up.  During the time when we were children, everything is uncertainty, every step we made toward the world was a reflection of dealing with uncertainty.  When we grow up, we are told what to do: parents, friends, primary school/secondary school/high school/university teachers, then seniors and supervisors.  Therefore it is strikingly scary to do something on our own after years of being told what was right and what should be done.  Flapping our own wings start with first we have to believe that we can fly, then willing to risk a lot of thing on the way trying – including some of the really bad hits on the face.  Believe that we can do it is the first and the most important requirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a scene in Game of Thrones this season I really like, it was when the Lady of Tart meet the Hound and Arya, she wants to take care of Arya from the Hound to the safe place.  The Hound answers: “Safety, where is that?”.  It is somewhat similar to the business world today.  I look into my left, right, front, behind, and ask myself: “Safety, where is that?” – I see a no clear answer.  So if I don’t learn how to deal with uncertainty now, be the person I want to be as soon as possible, then it will already be too late to start later and too risky to hide in a safety place.  And where is that place anyway?  Supposedly not in a big corporation with 10 years of experience in something where the experience get obsolete equally fast with technology and new business models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can entrepreneurs deal with downside concentrated risk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will protect myself with partnerships.  Some fear it after bad relationships roll-out.  Many of the very high level, successful, and respected persons I know claims not to invest in any private deal passively without control (without control supposedly would be: less than 51%, without information right, and a controlled Chief Accountant/CFO position).  One control deal would be doable. When we decide to do deals instead of a deal, it would be too much heavy to control everything.  To diversify and build downside protection, I believe the best we can do is form weak/strong strategic allies with our partners/prospect-partners.   Weak/strong partnerships are partnerships where we don’t have to meet on a regular basis and have a close-knit personal relationship with but those persons share the same core values, be ethical, hold the same vision (you can have multiple visions), and complement each other on skills and knowledge.  Never forget partnership risk, therefore, partnership is one of the largest risk we will take on our lives.  Just like investors, entrepreneurs are the ones who have a hand into the deal flows.  Rarely any entrepreneurs I work with lack of anything to do in their lives at any time.  If they fail in one idea, there is another deal will flow into their hand and partners who want to form partnership with them.  Be an unreliable person, then their downside protection is gone and then all of their eggs are really in just one basket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it – anything worth doing can’t be done alone.  It’s the doing awesome things with awesome people make life worth living as well as protect us from the downside uncertainty.  Be very selected and wise, guard your partners with all your ability.  Build the relationship and the road.  They will be the ones who ride with you on the upside and protect you on the downside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At early afternoon in November 15th last year, I was in working room of my boss, LP, co-founder and MD of VI Group as well as my ultimate mentor in VI Group.  We were having a discussion about modelling the production scenarios for the factory’s new product.  We wanted to find key components of cost structure and how they might change under different scenarios; ranging from changing raw materials input price to different production methods.  The deal we were doing was a tough one.  As the way he put it, we had done a quite lot of things HBS (Harvard Business School) would want to write case studies for (he is a HBS alum, among the first Fulbright generation in Vietnam).  We had fierce partnership level fighting at the beginning.  We had the hostile buy-out.  We restructured raw material supplying industry and changed the rules of how the industry compete.  We did R&amp;amp;D since the first day we stepped into the industry and found new products that made the waste of the main product makes more profit than the original product itself - that put the whole industry upside down and basically changed forever the cost structure that had existed for nearly 30 years.  This deal taught me was how distressed investment similar to start-up.  Cash was low, bankruptcy risk was high, and management needs to act in a great deal of uncertainty and needs to have a strong tendency for actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then by the near-end of the discussion, he started to shared with me about his life in Russia and how he played chess.  We had a lot of sharing sessions like that and it could happen anytime during endless deal meeting.  In retrospect, I miss those good old days at VI Group very much when a good chunk of my learning happened just like that on the sideline of the battlefield.  Back to the day, LP put his hands behind his head, swung his chair, looked into the ceiling - “… you know, basically in chess there is only two groups of strategy: position and combination, and it is also similar in business world…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Position as a beyond critical strategic dimension&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right at this morning, few hours ago in Startup Asia Singapore 2014 conference, Le Hong Minh from VNG has just shared VNG survival stories in the past 10 years and his view about Mobile Messaging and how Zalo chooses its angle to compete with Viber and other Mobile Messaging platforms.  ”Positioning” happens everywhere in his session, running from as high as high-level strategic view to as low as detail execution of Zalo with its war in Vietnam.  Minh also shared his view about the myth “number one” of the market that I found tremendously satisfy to hear because I hold the same view.  It’s not that Zalo wants to be “number one” in the market at general but Zalo wants to locate itself to a specific position in user behavior and owns firm into that position.  In strategy, the problem with “number one” is that largest market share does not guarantee to be good all of the time.  First of all, the business owners will want to identify what the cost and benefit to put the business at “number one” position.  There are many advantages of being market number one such as economy of scale and scope, bargaining power toward suppliers and buyers.  However depends on the industry, these benefits are not always hold and with not the same appealing magnitude.  On the other side, aggressive gaining market leadership position may require large investment into production, aggressive marketing spending and sales commission, aggressive credit policies, that in the end hurts profitability, cash flow from operation, and most dangerous of all sustainability of company-wide strategic position.  Therefore, on the same fashion, Minh said with Mobile Messaging platforms there are many angles to view about “number one” - that depends on the geographical, features (free call in case of Viber, make new friends in case of WeChat, etc) so users doesn’t have to use only one Mobile Messaging platform, they can exist together; the question is what app will own what position in user’s behavior: in free call, in text messaging, in voice messaging, in finding new friends, and in playing games, etc.  This view can be seen as finding and penetrating a market position that is favorable for the company to defend against rivals and other forces (suppliers, clients, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is a larger view on position.  Remembering the time my boss started to play chess, because he was a math-centric student, he approached the game as a series of problems for him to solve.  He set traps so that the chess game becomes a series of battles in that he got a little bit of advantage over army (for example a trap to exchange a Castle for a Queen) after each trap and end the game with a dominating force - this is called “Combination” play.  Over time, he shifted his strategy to a more board-wide, and besides building traps along the way, he tried to allocate his army to strategic positions in the board and created pressure across the table.  That was what he called “Position” play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chess, like a lot of other similar to games that I play, is about thinking in advance, gathering and processing information, understand opponents, react to the situation, and try to gain advantages over time.  Strategy is a road map to solve the mission: defeating the opponent.  Positioning strategy in my boss’ view is a large-scale (not trying to gain advantage over small battles) to gradually penetrate all critical strategic positions (locations) in the board that creates pressure to the opponents and put the player to be in the most favorable positions for a final strike to kill the king.  I feel this even more significant in the game &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)&quot;&gt;igo&lt;/a&gt; (or “go” - a chess-similar game in Japan), a good move will not only (1) enlarge the player’s territory, but also (2) threaten opponent’s territories and (3) attack opponent’s troops and (4) defend player’s troops.  The more such moves are made, the more advantageous the player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think back, positioning was also my favorite strategy in games.  I was once an international-level player of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Empires_II:_The_Conquerors&quot;&gt;Age of Empires II&lt;/a&gt; during 2003-2004 and played with top-level players around the world, including MIDORI of China (No1 world after a L-Clan’s cup somewhere in 2003/2004), PL_PeEl (No1 Poland), and many others: Turkey, Japan, etc.  My strategy was to upgrade town hall to the next stage (Feudal Age) slightly quicker vs. my opponents around 1 minute (in this game, advantages are gained in time unit of seconds).  Afterward, I will bring 4 of my villagers across the map to rival’s base and find a favorable position to build my military base.  Wood camp is a critical resource during the game’s early stage and I would almost always target into it with infantry and skirmishers to harass rival’s economy.  The defining moment to win in an early-stage, aggressive attack (terminology: “Forward Strategy”) is to successfully build and defend a tower behind the wood camp and completely force all villagers of rivals out of it.  One of the most important implications of position strategy everywhere is that savvy players will know that the important point for you is also the important point for them to defend.  That’s why in chess, igo, or in Age of Empires, battles around the critical points are always fierce and definitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Combination is the right way to think of problem solving&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most annoying fallacy in people’s thinking to me is that people are so in love with the idea of a holy grail of one single-something can solve the problem that they care about.  Obviously life doesn’t work that way.  Smart is not enough.  And connections will become awkward if after making the connection you don’t have talents or any service to offer.  Being nice and get love from other don’t make things done.  To get something, we will need a combination with many factors that cover all of the important facets of the problem in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MECE&quot;&gt;MECE&lt;/a&gt; way (McKinsey’s invention of Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive).  We can think of it as a framework.  Framework like SWOT analysis, PEST analysis, Porter Five Forces are combinations that breakdown the problem into smaller categories and approaches those categories to solve problem.  After identifying a problem, people try to approach it in a scientific way and develop initial frameworks.  Through time the frameworks are tested and if they stand, they become the best practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, took his hands off his head and returned to reality after wandering through past stories, my boss closed the conversation on how to harmonize between position and combination.  Combination can support very well to position.  To archive a strategic position in the board, a set of combination developed.  Position is high-level, strategic thinking.  Combination is more like detail-level, tactical thinking.  Finally, strategy is only making sense if all of high-level thinking is reflected into value-added detail activities at operational level.  And, that, is among the most difficult thing to do in business.&lt;/p&gt;
