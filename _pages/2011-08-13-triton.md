This website serves as my notebook to shares ideas that I find exciting about.  My personal philosophy centralizes around finding the truths and take actions to make the world a better place.  I devote most of my time doing to so through entreprenerial endeavors because I believe business is a fine medium to express thinking and to push humanity forward.  I founded and is the CEO of Altair Alpha, an angels-backed holding company active in both commercial in consumer market (Atair Alpha) and industrial market (Altair Industries).  I started my career at Vietnam Investments Group (“VI Group”), a private equity firm on growth capital with USD 500M asset under management. My private equity experience includes strategy, valuation, and operation for prospects and portfolio investees as well as served as Deputy CEO and Board Member of the largest VI Group’s pharmaceutical/agricultural deal at the time with 9 M&As. After VI Group, I joined Cloudjet Solutions (“CJS”), a venture-backed SaaS firm that provides Human Resources Management application, as a Board Member.  In 2020, CJS has turned into a AI research lab.  During the same time, I also served as Director of Strategy and Investment at Mekong Communications, working on Mekong's capital structure and investment/divestment matters of its 9 subsidiaries.  I am an AmCham Vietnam’s Scholar and was an Executive Board Member of AIESEC Ho Chi Minh Local Committee.  I graduated from International University – Vietnam National University with a Bachelor of Business Administration.  I hope you enjoy the time spent on my website!
