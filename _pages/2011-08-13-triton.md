My personal philosophy centralizes around freedom and finding the truth.  I believe in meritocracy, free will, and uncertainty.  This website serves as a reflection of my thinking throughout my journeys rather than a structural document of what I know.  I hope through my stories, I can share another perspective of life and make the world a better place.

I'm a venturer.  I believe business is a medium to express thinking, to fight for a cause, and to push humanity forward.  I spend most of my time on Altair Alpha, a venture in used books and paper recycling industry.  Concurrently, I also serve as a Board Member of Cloudjet Solutions (“CJS”), a venture backed cloud based firm that provides management applications in Human Resources to small and medium businesses in Vietnam.  Throughout my career, I have worked on over 100 deals and ventures across 19 industries (total estimate accumulated deal size around USD 650M), raised capital several times, and facilitated a strategic trade-sale exit.  I started my career as a private equity professional at Vietnam Investments Group ("VI Group"), a premier private equity firm in Vietnam specializing on expansion capital with USD 500M asset under management across 3 funds.  My private equity experience included strategy, valuation, and negotiations for prospect and portfolio investees as well as serving as Deputy CEO and Board Member of the largest VI Group's pharmaceutical/agricultural deal with 9 M&As.  Prior to VI Group, I was an Executive Board Member of AIESEC Ho Chi Minh Local Committee, serving as Vice President of External Relations.  I am an AmCham Vietnam's Scholar and has a Bachelor of Business Administration in Accounting and Finance from International University - Vietnam National University.
