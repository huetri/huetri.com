“Price is what you pay.  Value is what you get.” – Warren Buffett

There are many kinds of risk in the financial market, however, one of the most fundamentally severe exposure of risk an investor might come up with is investing with the wrong perception of value-price relationship.  Or investing with a complete blank mind on what the value-price relationship looks like.

Price is the market denomination, everybody sees it.  Value is a much more difficult subject.  Value is the perception of asset worth in the mind of the investor.  Price is the same for everybody.  Value of a company is likely to be different between you and me.  And it’s more than just subjective beliefs that separates you and me.  It might also be exact science that we are both wrong.  It is similar to a scenario that you worship Jesus, I worship Buddha, and Stephen Hawking comes and says: “I do not believe in a personal god”.  Maybe there is a true intrinsic value exits in each of the asset class.  It does not mean it has to be static, but it is dead science and no subjectivity.  Or there is no such thing exists and value is a hidden derivative of an asset that constantly change with changing investors’ subjective perceptions.

\[Picture\]

This is a complex matter and is unfarthomable in my limited understanding, yet in the quest for generating better returns, a natural option is to choose higher risky investment assets.  However, if one don’t know what she gets when she pays for, she is exposing into additional risk that does not lead to better return.  This blur line between value and price is particularly true in unconventional times such as Tulip Mania in 1636-1637, Tech bubble in 2000-2001, and Housing crisis in 2007-2008 when the fear of missing an opportunity is larger than the fear of losing money and the emotion runs higher than calmness of the mind.  Interesting enough, this kind of emotions and psychology seem to get human’s mind all of the time and repeat over and over.

To explain this, fundamentally price and value are two side of the coin that are driven by different factors.  Value of a company is deprived mainly by two schools of thought: (1) Net value of current assets – the value investing school, and (2) Value of future cash flow - the growth investing school.  Both of these methods come up with a valuation of a company regardless of how high the demand for the company stock or how hot currently the industry that the company is in.  On the other side, price come from supply and demand for the stock.  Price depends on the number of buyers (and their buying power) and the number of sellers (and their portion of holdings that are available to sell).  The reason of the buy and sell decision might come from perceived value of a company at the time of the transaction, but it is not always the case.  Beyond, it is generally not the case for the public.  How many retail invetors build a discounted cash flow model with sophisticated established fundamental relationships and track assumptions about the company future revenue that reflect valuation for each of the company in their portfolio?  Possibly not so many.  The reasons can be as wide as just receiving salary, rumors from neighbors and friends of friends, or expectation that the price will continue to go higher in the foreseeable (infinity?) time.

When price moves, it alters the risk-reward relationship of an asset.  This relationship is correct even in speculation with a short holding time period: the higher the price, the more difficult the flip.  A fundamentally strong company with a high stock price may be a bad investment because all the intrinsic value of the company is already absorbed by the stock price that there is little room for the stock to move higher.  Vice versa for a fundamentally weak company with a significant discounted stock price can be a low-risk and high return investment given the price is well below what should be the value of the company.

No asset is too good to be bought with any price, and I have never seen an asset that goes straight up forever.  And it’s fatal to have no thinking over value when looking at the price.  When buying a house in 2007, possibly investors tell with themselves that the housing market have steadily going up for the last 100 years (averaging about 2% annually in US market), the population is increasing in the face of sea-water rising.  Those arguments in accompanied with price increasing everyday blurs the value side of the investment as well as risk management parameters   That’s safe bet turned out to be one of the worst meltdown in financial markets.
