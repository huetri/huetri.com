      description: "This picture was taken during my last trip back to Ca Mau to visit VNO's management when I departed VI Group.  The background was the shrimp heads and shells that had been purified and transformed from aquaculture waste into the main pharmaceutical ingredient for glucosamine-medicine producing.  This is one of the final stage where the shrimp heads and shells, after chemical treatment, are dried under the sun light for a few days before stocking into the final chitin product.  The workers would walk back and forth across the \"chitin field\" to turn around the heads and shells for a well-rounded dry.  This is one of my favorite picture in this deal, taken March 8th, 2014."

      description: "HCMC from IDG Venture Vietnam Office.  My friend in IDG told me there are three special things he sees from here: (1) Occasionally when the rains come, you'll stand right in the spot that splits between the raining-territory and the non-raining territory, (2) Occasionally, you'll see cloud-raining at the far zones in the horizon, where there are multi-cloud with multi-raining zones - just look like multi-UFO-planes are approaching the Earth, and (3) Occasionally, the rainbows will appear right below your feet (IDG is at 57th floor).  His favorite game is to sit in the company's pantry and play the game \"finding buildings\".  I agree all of those things are pretty cool :)). - 2013 Feb."

      description: "A representative of some angles in this dynamic city that I think will last for the next hundred years.  Interestingly, looking at this old church reminds me on how dynamic this world is.  With multi-dimensions, multi-forces, and multi-traditions that separate between what are perceived at optimal solutions and what are actually done.  A typical conflict between the Lexus and the Olive Tree.  Optimal solutions base on economic metrics will always be not what people as general looking for. - 2013 Feb"
    - title: "Portland Birdview"

      description: "Portland is a weird and interesting city.  Excepting from its raining that depresses me every time, it is a beautiful city with old architecture at downtown and exceptionally nice people.  Even though Portland is not a major financial center such as New York, not a main management consulting hub such as Chicago, and not the future of US such as Bay Area.  It retains some of US's largest and notable corporations' factories and headquarters (Nike, Intel, etc).  Before my trip back to Vietnam in Late Feb.  Coincidentally I had a very nice conversation with Kurt Welty, Commodity Manager at Intel, on his trip to Las Vegas.  He led some of large negotiation deals in Intel strategic sourcing  all around the world.  I didn't miss the chance to learn about his experience through his sharing, on what are perceived to be his largest interests around his negotiation tables.  What he likes and what he doesn't.  What he did and what he is going to do.  We talked and shared about schools, works, countries, travels, markets, and everything during our waiting time before boarding.  It's not always that warmness when you go around, here and there.  But mostly if we dare to explore, turn to the next person and start a conversation - I believe those meetings are the best presents that we take home. - 2013 Feb"

      description: "Stanford is a great school not only for its top quality faculty and high flexibility in personal customized curriculum, but also for its surrounded ecosystem: Bay area, Palo Alto, San Jose.  That is a great point about great schools.  They never stand alone.  Harvard, Wharton, MIT, Columbia, NYU go with New York City and Washington DC.  Kellogg and University of Chicago go with the greater Chicago area.  No one comes to these school with the \"school only\" perspective."

      description: "Probably the newest of the top business schools.  Look modern but not so high-tech.  I thought it was a castle-like school such as the Booth School of Business or the likes :)) yet, everything looks shining and the students and facilities look fantastic.  It was a great motivation to be there and feel the environment."

      description: "\"...those from Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan in New York don't really want to take Haas and Stanford students to their summer program in New York.  The issue is not about the quality.  But the students in these schools after finishing their internship don't want to come back a cold place such as New York - those who already live in this area just don't want to relocate to another area...\" - I laughed really hard."
