      description: "Russia Mountains 2 - Look closely at the picture, I see what used to be a very large river.  Don't know if it is a glacier.  Even such a large glacier like the one in this picture can't escape time and natural changes.  Looking and talking among ourselves may bring a feeling of how big human is, going out and seeing things in nature reminds me of how small human is. - 2013 Feb."
