      description: "This is Hang En, the world 3rd largest cave in the heart of Quang Binh province, Vietnam, that I visited with my other significant one Phuong Phan on our two-day trip.  It used to be the 2nd largest cave in the world and the Vietnam's largest cave before the discovery of Son Dong in 2009.  The most interesting thing we discovered out of this cave was that the cutest school of fishes ever that seemed to be much more curious compare to the already high-curious travelers.  I got many mini bites from those tini cave friends in the cave pool and discovered myself pretty fish-yummy [?]."

      description: "I won't do any IT business without discussing with Hong as well as I won't do any app business without consulting Jason's ideas.  This May 6th of 2014 picture was taken for the first time Hong and Jason met each other.  We, with Phuong Phan from VIG, had a very interesting discussion on next ideas and current hot ventures. Jason is founder of TinyWhale [http://tinywhale.net/] which just launched Retro, an instagram viewer app for iPad, which has a lot of coverage from Apple App Store, TechCrunch, AppAdvice, etc.  Picture taken by Phuong Phan in Singapore just a few days before Jason launched Retro."

      description: "One of my favorite spot in VIG - this picture is taken by a great friend/colleague of mine at the end of September 2012.  To me a great friend of value is the one who will make my face looks like this.  Because we won't normally talk about easy things.  In our normal discussions, we challenge each other's perspective by posing some of very straight and tough questions.  After all, that was the way I have grown up.  And that will be the way I want to grow up.  Courtesy: Thao Ly - 2013 Feb"
