      description: "My favorite picture from Japan trip: a traditional Shinto wedding ceremony at 明治神宮（Meiji Jingu Shrine).  The bride wore traditional white kimono called shiromuku and the groom wore montsuki (black formal kimono), haori (kimono jacket), and hakama (kimono pant).  The couple was only followed by families members and close relatives.  The walk was very slow and tranquil.  It was in mid-noon when the group started to walk - of course - under the awe of all nearby Japanese and tourists."
