This post continues [Price movement - market proxies (1)](https://huetri.com/2012/01/18/price-movements/ "Price movement - market proxies (1)") to study the price movement - the ruling factor of the market.

Markets are established in mostly simple structures; because of that, they stand in between of everything.  The most basic function of the market is to facilitate transactions.  When everyone has a leg on the circle, the game becomes sophisticated: they all try to get ahead.  On the other hand, price is the mean of the market.  Consequently, catching the right prices is ultimately one of the most critical aspect of attending the market.  Need not saying, price actions therefore become extremely interesting and unpredictable.

Before going further I want to notice that in order to study the price movements I have to give up some beliefs.  First, it's the belief that price movements are totally Random Walk.  You just can't study a thing that you believe that it is random, at least you have to doubt its randomness.  Randomness guarantees it's out of predictability which makes all of studies on the price movements useless.  It's still debatable whether price movements are random by theorists, yet I choose to believe that price movements are not random for itself but a mean to reflect others' beliefs on the market.  When price goes up, it's reflecting a belief, as well as when price goes down.  Secondly, more important, price itself reflects everything the current market is gauging.  Thirdly, because price reflects everything, the market has to be efficient.  This is another important factor. If the market is not efficient in term of transparency and dominance, the dominant players can easily move the market and draw the price chart by their will.  That will make price movements studying has no meaning because price doesn't reflect all of the current market information, public and nonpublic.

**\- (2) Diagnosis - **

I thought out, or to be more exact, extracted out from the price movements 6 factors that I think can explain the behaviors of the price movements.  They are: range, volatility, time, point, pattern, and angle.  Each factor gives me a way to look at the price movements and the combination of them provides me a better way to interpret what is going on.  This is incomplete, I think, and I still keep an eye on finding the next factor that lightens another perspective or even can turn all of these things around.  Notice that I may use different definitions for the factors above, I'll make them clear when I reach them in detail.  Below is an illustrative summary:

[![](http://69.195.124.154/~huetrico/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/6-factors-of-market-movements.png "6 factors of market movements")](http://69.195.124.154/~huetrico/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/6-factors-of-market-movements.png)

Let's go through them one by one.

**Range** - I see range as a complete move of the market.  In the illustrative picture above, range is the whole move from (A) to (Z) in which (A) is the beginning of the move and (Z) is the ending of the move - when the market tops and turns around.     In this view, range reflects the trend and includes direction.  I start with range because it's extremely difficult to pick the right profitable points, however it's easier to point out the direction as well as the trend.  When one already sees the trend, one question must immediately come: Whether is the trend still alive? or rephrasing: How long will it last? therefore I use range at the ultimate outcome of a trend: range reflects high and low of the trend, as well as its direction.

**Volatility -** is reflected at red color and choppy price movements above.  Volatility is a so familiar factor of price actions, the friend of extremely short-term traders and enemy of longer term investors.  Volatility is the fluctuations of price around main direction (reflected as the thick blue line).  The worst thing about volatility is it hits the stop loss before going into the right direction.

**Time -** Time is the final discovery of Jesse Livermore, at around his final years in 1930s.  This information must excite you, sadly I don't know what he saw.  Yet trust me, time is one of the most important as well as ignored factors in the market.  I just start to care about time lately.  When I first think about it, I was extremely surprised that I almost didn't notice that before for years and almost none of my books mentioned about time in the perspective of price actions.  I know time is the final discovery of Jesse Livermore for long through a blur piece of information - and because of that I just didn't proceed to study more.  Yet since I realize the existence of time, I changed my whole view about the market.  Now I see it like a piece of continuing symphony or life cycle with a daily rotation of sun and moon.

**Point -** Point is the price level that goes harmony with time.  Point is another familiar factor that is used very crowded by investors.  Mostly people use resistance and support lines to identify point, or price levels that they prefer.  Another tool which is used to find point is Fibonacci retracement levels that first discovered by Fibonacci in 13th centuries when observing the population growth of rabbits.  Gann Fan, or Gann Angles, developed in 1935 by Gann is also employed even though by less extensive level.

**Pattern -** Patterns are the most direct reading from price actions.  Old European and American traders used bar chart.  Yet the Japaneses Candlestick is getting dominant because of its superior visual power.  Candlestick is the closest point of standing next to the market.  There is tick chart which measures almost every market move in real-time but using the tick chart just make sure that your hand will be burned.  I've learned that the closer I stand to the market, the worse shape I got burned.  There are patterns stand a little bit far away from the current price actions.  They are larger market patterns (away from candlestick forming at a single point in time) like flags, triangle, wedge, etc.

**Angle -** Angle is the gray line I draw across the illustrative picture above.  Actually, angle is a derivative from range and time, and because of that, I normally use angle to gauge the sustainability of a trend.  The faster the price moves from (A) to (Z), the steeper the angle becomes.  In order to have the angle, you have to wait for price to move for a long period.  I see angle as the farthest factor related to the price actions.

Market changes over time.  And almost there is no any same moment of the market.  A day passes by, and the range may stand still or increase a little bit, volatility may continue to hover, time get a little bit longer, points may change, pattern may be forming/destroying, and angle may go up or down.  The worst/most interesting thing about the market is that every shape is possible, there is even shapes that totally go out of your imagination.  So when you analyze closely the price movements you may draw out 5-6 scenarios and rank them from base case to unexpected case.  Sadly, almost you can always find a way to explain the unexpected, and you can always justify a price movement.
