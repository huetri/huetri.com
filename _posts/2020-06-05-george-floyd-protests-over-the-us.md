The United States is going through another turbulent time as people are taking over the streets across the country over the death of George Floyd. This is of course only the tip of the iceberg over the problem of racism and inequality that have existed in our country for hundred of years. Though over the decades, a lot of improvements have been made and the situation now is better than any where in the past, incidents such as the death of George Floyd or the difference in income and unemployment rate among races show there are still a long journey ahead and many more works to get done. Now, protests cannot go on forever and months from now the anger of the people will subside. But let not this moment be forgotten and use this moment to learn and educate ourselves about inequalities and issues in the country we live in today. These problems have existed for hundreds of years and are systematic, that means they won't be solved by a few weeks of protests. They can be solved, however, but that will be over a long series of changes that might take over generations, from both at political stages and at each of us on the action we take everyday.

Still, this is a very complex situation we are in and it takes me time to navigate in this matter. The situation also includes in itself a crossroad of many social issues from police brutality as the core to a broader quest to reform for a better society and equal opportunity for black communities. Many protests have turned violent, businesses are ransacked and people are shot and killed send a mixed message on if this is a just course of actions or another derailed movement that was originally built on a right cause.

First of all let's focus on the issue at its core. This is a case on police brutality and this is a very sad incident that should never happen. Surprisingly, in the US in 2014 there are more than 1000 people are killed by the police compared to almost zero to other developed Western countries such as Germany, UK, and Australia (Source: Campaign Zero). There are many more of George Floyd incidents that were never come to the surface. Also according to Black Census 2019 report (by Black Future Labs) of over 30,000 participants from black communities, up to 77% responsed the killing of police officers toward black people as a major concern and 76% responded Police officers not being held accountable for their crimes as a major concents. This is of course not right and there is a need to change. However, calling to defunding the entire department or abolish the department or protest with radical ideas such as "FTP" (F... the Police), or "ACAB" (All Cops Are Bastard) is not the answer. Let not forget the police also is a crucial component of our society and the protectors of the community. In my life and work in the US I have encountered the police several times and they either protect my family and business from thieves or protect my personal safety from a crazy ex-employee that was high on meth. I find it is hard to imagine if not most of the people who serve in the police department want to do good with their career and bring justice to society. I also believe many of them are trapped in between with this incident, one side they empathize with the tragedy of their department over yes another case of police brutality, but also another side they are attacked and provoked and under intense pressure of looters, overly radicalized protestors. My call for this matter is please be calm, think with a clear head. The anger is understandable, but let not that be a barrier to a real change that people can do over the momentum that has been built. Also please don't demonize all police force and call for anachy. That is just not the solution.

Over the above matter, I find Center for Policing Equity ([https://policingequity.org/](https://policingequity.org/ "https://policingequity.org/")) is doing direct works with police departments across the country and Color of Change ([https://act.colorofchange.org/signup/state-emergency-black-people-are-dying](https://act.colorofchange.org/signup/state-emergency-black-people-are-dying "https://act.colorofchange.org/signup/state-emergency-black-people-are-dying")) is doing petition for changes in police practices. There are of course many more that I don't know. But these are realistic work that might change the system than vandalize walls with anachy graffiti.

On protesting, I went to protesting sites 3 times and joined in one peaceful demonstration in downtown Portland, Oregon. Protesting is necessary to raise awareness and is the start for any movement to gain social traction, which can leap into a real change. Peaceful protests should continue and should may even be conducted periodically to remind people about work in progress in this social issue, not just for memorial of one fallen person after an injustice incident and stop after that. Still, protests should be organized better and to be fair things have gone substantially better now comparing to when the protests just started as violence decreased and more people show up (as a factor of decrease in violence and looting). Due to business traveling, I have opportunity to see the results of protesting in Portland, Tacoma, and Seattle over the past week and saw in reality the damages of the looters and violent protesting has caused for community. This should be stopped and should not be endorsed under the name of fighting for injustice. Destroying other people's work and dream and looting other people's assets cannot be justified as a by product of a call for justice. Dr. Martin Luther King's succes in Civil Right Act in 1964 and Voting Right Act in 1965 wasn't because of the violence of protesting, but because the peaceful and well organized marches that people feel safe to come out and join with him in his calling. I understand this is a very difficult time for protest organizers and there are many people with other motives behind standing up for George's injustice. But imagine how much more success this movement would have become should the protests are more well organized. Small buisnesses might show in big time support instead of blocking off their store behind board as a symbol of fear and separation. Thousands more people would come out and join the cause (with appropriate social distancing) instead of staying at home and be worry on if the protest happens near where they live.

I also find in stressed times like this where there are chaos and conflicts of views, it helps to stay clear headed and calm, research and read views of many sides, don't radicalize, and follow authorities who are thoughtful and knowledgeable about the matter. It might be too easy to be emotional and be radical. But it pays to be calm and thoughtful. In the end social matters like this won't be solved in a short period of time. Years from now the black communities will benefit more from the change in attitudes and actions toward them for the rest of your life. Or the efforts that you will put in (or votes) on issues that matter to them and their children. Let's not be an angry protestor go around destroying things and be a knowledgeable citizen take correct political and social actions toward changes that need to happen to make society a better place.

I include in this post a link to an essay of Obama about the matter:

In his post he also directed support toward activist groups that are working toward inequality and demand positive change for black communities. I did check them out and make a round of donations to organizations I feel aligned on the missions and agenda. I engourage you to research about this social issue and contribute to the cause (on your own way, of course).

Black Futures Lab supports black communities by engaging into political activities across local, state, federal so that black communities are better served by policies. [https://blackfutureslab.org/](https://blackfutureslab.org/ "https://blackfutureslab.org/")

Campaign Zero is a data site with infomative info on police brutality and realistic demand of change.

Lastly, National Bail Fund - this would bail some radical and violent protestors out but this would also bail many other activists that are legitimately fighting for this positive change.
