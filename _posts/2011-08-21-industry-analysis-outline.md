This is my fundamental combination on analyzing an industry.  I often get trouble on deciding how to start looking at something - especially a new business or a potential investible listed company.  Hence, I construct this fundamental industry analysis outline, totally based on theories and working experience on VI Group, to keep me focusing on what is important.

Understanding the dynamic of the industry is critical to any business.  However, from my personal observation, not many small and medium businesses do have a formal industry analysis - even those companies are established from those who are very experienced in the industry.  A formal industry analysis backed by facts and thinking might prevent some hasty generalizations and unsound assumptions from business owners and answer the question: "Should I do this business?".  Besides, understanding the industry helps answer some other critical questions:

*   Where will this industry go in the future? by how? and how do I respond?
*   Should I sell my business (exit) or invest more on it, by how much?
*   If I make this move, how will the players (competitors, buyers, suppliers, and external factors) respond?
*   What determines the price in the industry? How will price and cost structure change in the future?

Additional Notes: - Some industry analyses have a "global section" (global outlook, global demand and supply...).  There is no need to have a fix scope for the analysis.  The scope depends on the reach of the business.  Some funds has global exposure often make the industry analysis on global perspective.  Other local funds with local exposure includes global section as an additional note for their international investors. - This industry analysis outline is very equity perspective.  Hence, debtors might have a very different range of interest as well as tools applied.
