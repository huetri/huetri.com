Contrary to the image most of my friends think about me, I don't take books reading too seriously.  I read slow.  To make the matter worse, I only read when I feel the mood for reading.  I don't force myself reading ever.  However, I treat reading as a part of personal development and that I take super seriously.  On a daily basis, I work on spending 1 hour to 2 hours on minimum (more than that is hard) on independent personal development activities.  Though it only represents 4% to 8% of daily time, keeping this habit going is challenging.  Still, I have no doubt this commitment will compound through time and be a major contributor to what I can do in the future.

What I mean about independent personal development activies is the "extra" learnings I do on my own personal time beyond regular professional works.  Of course, when you work, you learn new things, and you grow.  That's good, but generally not enough.  Besides reactive reasons that the world is now changing fast and who don't adapt will fail and competition is happening on global scale and some rivals will snap you from the darkness yadi yadi yadi.  I think one of the key thinking on this front is: How far can you go?  For me now, I no longer mind on the world changing fast argument nor global competition argument.  I accepted that reality and moved past that.  What I care now is am I achieving what I'm capable of? or what's the limit of my capability? I want to explore those out.  This view shift personal development become more of a personal journey.  Personal development is then no longer a forced thing where we have to react to adversity changes but a journey that we embrace and joyfully take to explore things we know will be exciting but we don't know their existence yet.

Come back to reading, reading is a great mean to learn.  I always say that if a person, let say Ray Dalio, spends his whole life building BridgeWater and achieves what he is capable of and then writes a books about it and sells for $18.  Then I can just buy the book and spend 20 hours reading it (I read slow) and learn his lessons.  That's a phenomenal bargain.  On the same view, I'm after Peter Drucker' books, David Rubenstein's book (he is writing one), Malcolm Gladwell's books, Peter Thiel's books, Thich Nhat Hanh's books, Aswarth Damodaran's books and many other world-class thinkers that I admire.  As far as my memory goes, Bill Gates and David Rubenstein read no less than 50 books a year about a wide variety of topics.  My thinking is if these people at the top of the world spend their precious time and learn that ferrociously, then there is no excuse for younger people like me don't take learning seriously.  The now generation when they die should not hand over the world to a lesser capable generation.

Big picture thinking aside, reading does offer some great benefits beyond just knowledge.  Now, I'm not that crazy about knowledge either.  I'm more of an action oriented person.  No action taken, no value created.  Best value-adding actions come from people with great character, abilities, skills, imagination, experience, then knowledge.  So most of the time, I don't read for knowledge.  I read with the mindset of taking action.  Therefore, I prefer to read slow and think through the ideas.  Why the author come up with this idea, what's the line of reasoning? Under what context? Apply to what situation? Is the idea reasonable? Can I use it? How/where/when/with whom? When I read, I'm ready to note down ideas into "Short-Term To Do" list and "Long-Term Thinking" to revisit the ideas.  When the idea is a briliant idea that can be implemented immediately, I put create a calendar event to take action immediately.  A few more benefits of reading I see is that it generally calms my mind, acting as a form of meditation.  I feel happier after reading and I observe that my decision making quality improves when I maintain a steady reading schedule everyday.

Now, go off the books reading, I also read articles, watch and listen to people I admire share their ideas.  This include reading blog posts (for example of Paul Graham or especially Howard Marks), watching commencement speeches of notable universities (Harvard, Yale, MIT, Duke, etc), peer-to-peer interviews (my favorite show is The David Rubenstein's Show by Bloomberg, Washington DC Economics Club interviews, Oxford Union interviews, or Charlie Rose interviews), or documentaries.  A lot of these activities can be done when I drive, making a net saving on time.  From my experience, a lot of the learning through this form don't come straight into actions such as reading books, especially books on topic we care about or seeking an answer for something.  But this type of personal development goes into forming the character, enhancing and building up abilities, adjusting thinking principles, that is more beneficial into the long-run.  Put it this way, a lot of things we do everyday are influenced by higher-level way of thinking and perceiving life.  If we can learn the high-level principles of thinking and approaching life from the best thinkers, it will help in the long-run.

Lastly, as online learning is liberating high quality content to average people everywhere with an internet connection.  It's good to learn from formal and informal online courses some of the time.  I listened to Yale, NYU, and Harvard courses here and there.  I know MIT and Stanford courses are also now available mostly for free.  I also subscribe to a company called Master Class where Phil Ivey here got featured to this blog post.  For Master Class, I learned Daniel Negrenu and Phil Ivey on poker, Paul Krugman on economics, James Suckling on wine tasting.  I'm learning from David Axelrod and Karl Rove on Politics Campaigning and from Malcolm Gladwell on writing.  I want to check out briefly Stephens Curry course on Basketball not to learn the tactics and the drills but to get a feel on how this guy thinks.  I will do the same with Gary Kasparov on his Chess class.  The cost for subcription is $180/annually and considering the value of the content, this is super cheap.

I want to learn ferrociously.  Learning never stops at school and it is best after the school - where you are matured enough to know what you want to learn about.  And you don't have to learn to compete with anyone.  You just might want to learn to enjoy the time learning (be happy right there) and see where it leads you too.  You will also want to see what's your capable of and when you reach there, what you'll see next on the horizon.
