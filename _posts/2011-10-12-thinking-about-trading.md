_\- Dedicated to all of my friends who live with the market ups and downs -_

If anyone asks me should she get into the stock market, forex market, or whatever kinds of financial market to make some money - my answer would be "absolutely not".  It's quite funny that when people think about the stock market, they think of a huge opportunity to just buy and get rich quick.  People tend to ask portfolio managers questions like: "do you know which stocks should I buy for now and get some good return over a year?", or make a simple phone call to a broker and ask for inside information, or more fundamental: going to bookstores to buy (this number is already exacerbated for most people I think) 10 books and read in a month and take all their army (i.e. money) to the battlefield.

From all people I've chance to talk/meet with, none of them made a fortune by active trading in the market, whatever kind of market.  I've read somewhere in MarketWatch that 1% of day traders beat the stock market.  Months ago, a gold dealer director in Vietnam told me there is less than 10% of people who trade in their platform made money, he added "or even much less" - and for those who lose, they lost all.

From guru side, Jesse Livermore lost all of his fortune that he made in 1907 panic in years of 1910-1915.  Then Jesse bet right on the great depression in 1929, made around $1.3 billion in today's dollar ($100 million that time) and lost all of them only 5-10 years later.  Buffett doesn't active trade.  Roubini doesn't hold stock at this time from last article I read and he compared trading like suiciding.  John Paulson who made a fortune from the last 2008 crisis down 31% so far in his Recovery Fund.  In only September, his gold investment fund lost 16% compare with 11% of gold fall and his Recovery Fund lost 14%.

From fund side, LTCM was absolutely the most famous of trading example: the fund established by 2 economic Nobel Prize laureates Black & Scholes and the world's pioneer and most famous bond trader in 1980s-1990s John Meriweather of Salomon Brothers with a team of computer science and math geeks from Harvard and MIT.  Result: the fund's failure in 1998 was too big that Fed and a series of banks in US had to bail them out to prevent a global financial crisis.  I stop here just not to overwhelm and discorage you on your investing/trading journey.

Jesse Livermore once said trading/speculating is like solving the world's most complex puzzle and the stock market is designed to fool most people - that's why most of them fail.  It's the simplicity of the actions in the market that make people dig their own grave: buy and sell.  Like a slot machine with two buttons, whether you do homework or not, whatever your thinking is, whoever you are, how many years of experience, all you can do is put the buttons: buy and sell.  So you're fundamentalist? only Buffett is courage enough to say he doesn't sell (and he's the only one I know to do so too, mutual funds do a lot of rebalancing).  I see a lot of people categorize the action buy and sell to trading, investing, speculating, swinging, etc.  From my personal perspective that's only add more color to life.  Jesse Livermore is consider the greatest speculator of all time - and people regarding him as gambling/plunging/speculating the market.  Yet if you really study about him you'd know his strategy was medium-long term buy and hold in bullish market and medium term short and wait in bearish market.  And he did much more fundamental things than people thought (remember that all of technical analysis or even candlesticks weren't available at that time).  He once said no one could ever beat the market all the time, getting in and getting out - this is just absolutely opposite with a day/swing trader.  When people demonize George Soros for being gambling and speculating the market they just don't know who he is.  Find out all of videos, interviews, conferences (include the most prestige Davos) you'll find none of what he said regarding to technical analysis or the like.  He's among the most macro fundamentalist I know who has been consistently beating the market for the last 30-40 years.  George Soros regards himself as a philosopher, and I see him at what he sees himself.

Another interesting perspective I'd like to think about trading is regarding it as a chess game, yet there is some dramatic differences.  In a normal chess game you do 1-vs-1, this game is multi-vs-multi (some want the idea of heroism, think I-vs-the-world, this idea is right only when you consistently pick right troughs and tops).  In a normal chess game you choose your opponents, mostly those same level with you, this game you are forced to play with the world's champions.  In a normal chess game, technology doesn't play any role, this game the champions control all the advantages.  Losing a chess game you don't jump off the bridge, this game, just a personal thinking, must be one of the leading career for those who suicide?

I would say trading, that's buying and selling, requires a lot of real time, real effort, and yet gurantees for nothing but a better realizing for yourself.  I hope at least for those who want to "get-quick-rich-without-effort" won't come to a NASA's physicist and ask for how to make some quick money.  And for those who're already on the journey wish you all the patience, poise, and determination.  If regarding it as one of the world's most complex puzzles, it should be one of the world's most interesting puzzles too.
