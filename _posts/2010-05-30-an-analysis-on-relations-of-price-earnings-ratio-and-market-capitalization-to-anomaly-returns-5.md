**CHAPTER IV**

**ANALYSIS OF RESULTS AND DISCUSSION**

_This chapter answers directly to the questions of relations between P/E ratios and Market Capitalization to anomaly returns. The empirical results also examine the P/E Effect, Size Effect, and the correlation between Market Capitalization and P/E ratios that are proven to be meaningful to investment community on basing their investment decisions._

**1\. P/E Effect** Here comes the answer of PE Effect in HoSE during 2007-2010 of total 161 companies analyzed under a series of 746 daily return observations. As the previous chapter has described, companies are grouped under 5 scales of P/E, from PE1 as Lowest P/E to PE5 as Highest P/E, then each 3 months, the portfolios are then regrouped as P/E of the previous period of companies changed. The table of result is shown accordingly:

[![](http://69.195.124.154/~huetrico/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/pe-effect.png "PE Effect")](http://69.195.124.154/~huetrico/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/pe-effect.png)

The results express a relatively interesting pattern: mean returns tend to increase alongside with alpha as P/E goes lower, even mean returns shown in the above table are negative dominant. There is also no specific volatility of standard deviation with a stable range from 2.03% to 2.13%. From the t-test result, only result of PE3 – “Moderate P/E” is found to have reliable positive abnormal returns of 0.06% at confidence interval of 95%.

So this result somewhat admits P/E indicators does lead to alphas but contradictory to findings of Nicholson (1960), McWilliam (1966), Miller & Widmann (1966), Breen (1968), and Basu (1977) about low P/E companies outperform high P/E companies and the market as a whole though its value premium. With Moderate P/E is found to give abnormal returns, this finding is supportive of the conclusions of Johnson, Fiore, and Zuber (1989) who stated that there were some abnormal returns by using P/E, but those excess returns were not come from low P/E stocks.

**2\. Size Effect** The Size Effect is also studied through the same manner as PE Effect with 12 3-month periods between March 2007 and March 2010 of total 161 selected companies in HoSE under a series of also 746 daily return observations. Size is divided by a scale of 5 with MC1 as Smallest Market Cap companies and MC5 as Biggest Market Cap companies. The table of result is shown accordingly:

[![](http://69.195.124.154/~huetrico/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/size-effect.png "Size Effect")](http://69.195.124.154/~huetrico/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/size-effect.png)

From the observations, the mean returns range from -0.09% to 0.02% with relatively stable standard deviation between 2.04% and 2.16%. The pattern found in P/E Effect does repeat in Size Effect: mean returns do have the tendency to be higher as Market Cap approach smaller group, MC4 and MC5 according to Big and Biggest Market Cap group also have lowest daily mean returns of -0.08% and -0.09% respectively. Meanwhile, alphas are found to go alongside with that pattern with highest alpha belong to the group of Smallest Market Capitalization and lowest alphas belong to Big and Biggest Market Cap groups.

From the conventional student t-test, only MC1’s alpha of 0.09% satisfies the 95% confidence interval with p-value equal to 3%. Null hypothesis of alpha equal to 0 in this class hence rejected, leads to the conclusion of existence of abnormal high returns in Smallest Market Capitalization group.

So “Is Beta Dead?” – Probably! This finding is very supportive to Richard Michaud of Bache with his quote: “Instead of using beta model, I would probably like to use other factor such as capitalization”. Moreover, this finding is also strongly supportive to findings of Size Effect under studies of Banz and Reinganum (1981), Reinganum (1983, 1992), and Stoll and Whaley (1983). On an important notice of Stoll and Whaley (1983), they noted that on studying about Size Effect, researchers are strongly encouraged to take transaction cost into account. This study does take transaction cost into account and find that Size Effect is still upheld with considering transaction cost. The topic of transaction cost will be returned in the next sections.  Back to the relations with previous studies, whether this finding is contradictory to finding of Brown, Kleidon, and Marsh (1982)? – Not sure! Brown, Kleidon, and Marsh (1982) did reject the finding of Banz and Reinganum (1981) about a stable Size Effect (finally in 1992, Reinganum rejected the finding of Brown, Kleidon, and Marsh (1982) about their idea of unstable Size Effect) but their study also noticed that Size Effect is a Time-Period effect. It means that some period, Size Effect exists, but some period, Size Effect does not exist. The findings about Size Effect in this particular thesis are still not strong enough to state out whether Size Effect is a stable phenomenon or not due to the short time span of the study. However, thesis does prove that Size Effect exists, at least for the period from 2007 to 2010: Returns of risk-adjusted from smallest firms were most pronounced.

**3\. Relations between P/E Ratio and Market Cap to Anomaly Returns** Here comes a more complex issue: The matrix of P/E and Size. Reinganum (1981) stated that Size Effect subsumes P/E Effect, this means that P/E Effect was actually not significant, and Market Cap did the anomaly itself. Meanwhile, Basu (1983) argued that P/E Effect subsumes Size Effect, just the vice versa manner. So which subsumes which? – The answer from this finding is: none factor was subsumes by another factor and the anomalies were the real contribution of the two. The issue of correlation between Size and P/E will be addressed at the next section.

So like P/E Effect and Size Effect, any meaningful findings that satisfy the statistical test in this section would stand against EMH. The quintiles of Size (scale of 5 from Smallest to Biggest) and P/E (scale of 5 from Lowest to Highest) are mixed to 25 categories and numbered from M1 to M25 as shown once in the previous chapter:

[![](http://69.195.124.154/~huetrico/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/matrix-of-size-and-pe.png "Matrix of Size and PE")](http://69.195.124.154/~huetrico/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/matrix-of-size-and-pe.png)

[![](http://69.195.124.154/~huetrico/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/combination-result-of-size-and-pe.png "Combination result of Size and PE")](http://69.195.124.154/~huetrico/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/combination-result-of-size-and-pe.png)

[![](http://69.195.124.154/~huetrico/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mean-return-of-portfolio.png "Mean return of Portfolio")](http://69.195.124.154/~huetrico/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mean-return-of-portfolio.png)

In that, portfolios demonstrated mean returns range from -0.21% (belong to M19 – “Big Market Cap and High P/E”) to 0.10% (belong to M1 – “Smallest Market Cap and Lowest P/E”).

Through the table, we also notice that the stability of different Market Cap classes is also strongly different. With negative mean returns across the board, smallest Market Cap and lowest P/E portfolios seems to beat the market with relatively high return: M1 (Smallest MC – Lowest P/E), M6 (Smallest MC – Low P/E), and M13 (Mid Cap – Mod P/E). Worst performers belong to biggest Market Cap and highest P/E classes with noticeable negative returns lower -10% of M15 (Biggest MC – Mod P/E), M19 (Big MC – High P/E), and M24 (Big MC – Highest P/E).

Meanwhile, standard deviation reflect a quite stable figures with a range from 2.18% to 2.50%, there are not much significantly different in dispersions from the means of portfolio classes. On the other hand and also interestingly, through regression model, alpha founded tends to have noticeable differences:

[![](http://69.195.124.154/~huetrico/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/alphas-of-matrix-portfolios.png "Alphas of Matrix Portfolios")](http://69.195.124.154/~huetrico/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/alphas-of-matrix-portfolios.png)

M19 (Big MC - High P/E)’s lowest mean returns of -0.21% seems to be contributed by its abnormal low returns of -0.13%. Meanwhile, M1 (Smallest MC - Lowest P/E) tend to outperform the whole market with alpha of 0.18%. Most of other observations found alpha to be equal or lower than 0.5%, only M6 (Smallest MC – Low P/E) an M13 (Mid Cap – Mod P/E) shows a noticeable alpha of 0.15% and 0.14% respectively.

The conventional student t-test is then applied to test the reliability of findings, as shown included in the table; most of the alphas founded in this study are not statistically reliable according to statistical testing with relatively high p-value. There are only 4 findings are confirmed by statistical t-test: M1 (Smallest MC - Lowest P/E), M6 (Smallest MC – Low P/E), M13 (Mid Cap – Mod P/E), and M19. In that, M1, M6, and M13 confirm positive alphas of 0.18%, 0.15%, and 0.14% respectively, these are also the highest alphas of the research. M19 (Big MC - High P/E)’s alpha is found to be negative of -0.13%, alongside to the lowest mean returns of -0.21%.

In conclusion, evidence is found across the board with M1 (Smallest MC - Lowest P/E), M6 (Smallest MC – Low P/E), and M13 (Mid Cap – Mod P/E) have abnormal high returns with reliability. Meanwhile, M19 (Big MC - High P/E) is found to have abnormal negative returns.

This finding very much confirmed to the findings of Reinganum (1981) and Basu (1983) that the Size and P/E both contribute to anomaly returns but just stop at that point; the findings of this thesis did nothing to the weight of Size and P/E. Probably Size plays a higher role to P/E in anomaly returns because the Size Effect found in the previous section confirms that returns from smallest companies are most pronounced. In four accepted alphas of M1, M6, M13, and M19, two of the results (M1 and M6) belong to the smallest companies. With P/E Effect found in the previous section that moderate P/E companies tends to perform better to both smallest or highest P/E companies probably reflects in M13, a category of Mid MC and Mod P/E. However, everything is just guesses, the author tried to run a regression model to find a linear relationship between returns to P/E and Size. However, the model was rejected by having not passed the statistically significant test; this is also a great suggestion for further studies on P/E and Size.

However, without the linear regression, findings from this section are absolutely a meaningful anchor for investment professionals to put an eye on Smallest Market Cap and Lowest P/E Group as well as Mid Cap as potential indicators to abnormal high returns and Mod P/E and, surely, be careful to Big Market Cap and High P/E, which is found to own abnormal negative returns.

**4\. Correlation of Market Cap and P/E Ratios & other Considerations** The previous section once mentions the finding of Reinganum (1981) and Basu (1983) in their contradictory conclusions about whether Size subsumes P/E or P/E subsumes Size. This section tries to answer that question by running a correlation between Size and P/E.

[![](http://69.195.124.154/~huetrico/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/correlation-of-market-cap-and-pe.png "Correlation of Market Cap and PE")](http://69.195.124.154/~huetrico/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/correlation-of-market-cap-and-pe.png)

As shown in the table above, there is no significant relationship found in the correlation between Market Cap and P/E. Therefore, we can confidently announce that both P/E and Market Cap contributed independently to the abnormal returns found in 25 matrix portfolios.

Besides the correlation of P/E and Size, other factors like transaction costs are also taken into consideration. As Stoll and Whaley (1983) pointed out, transaction costs and specified holding period assumption (active, passive, etc.) did a strong effect to the final result of Size Effect. In this thesis, the transaction costs are calculated as follow:

Mean Daily Transaction Cost = (((Buy cost)\*8)/(5\*52))

The portfolios are reconstructed each 3 months, so at the beginning of the period, the portfolios incurred buy fee; and at the end of the period, the portfolios incurred sell fee. In a year, there will be 4 times portfolios are constructed, so stocks are bought 4 times a year. At the end of the study period, here 3 months, portfolios are released the entire by selling it, so stocks are sold 4 times a year. Buy cost and sell cost are set to be the same with 0.03% (in the formula we just take in buy cost as representative for both buy and sell fee charged) as the most used fee structured of securities companies in Ho Chi Minh City (the fee charged is also can be smaller, to 0.01%, if investors assumed as big traders or institutional investors). In the denominator, daily costs are taken as the 5-day week with a total of 52-week year. So the Mean Daily Transaction Cost is found to be:

Daily Transaction Cost = 0.000923077% = ((0.03%\*8)/(5\*52))

This number is then subtracted from alphas to find whether any significant change in results considered transaction costs. However, the transaction costs are found to be too small to alter the results. Therefore, considered transaction costs, all effects founded in this thesis are upheld valid.
