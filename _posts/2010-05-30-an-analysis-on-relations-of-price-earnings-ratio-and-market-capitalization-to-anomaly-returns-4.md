**CHAPTER III**

**STUDY DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY**

_The design of this study has gone through numerous parts with different ideas in different periods. The final results reflected the expansion of the research designs from its most initial idea. This chapter discusses about the design, forming structure, and decisions in choosing factors during study conducting process._

**1\. The Study Design** The most initial idea of this thesis is to find the relations between P/E ratios and Market Capitalization during the study period of 2007-2010 to anomaly returns. The findings aim to help investors and academic researchers understand more about the market, and then support them in their developing investment and economic models related to factors that potentially have predictive power to abnormal returns. The ideas have evolved over time as the thesis grows up. Finally, the thesis attempts to examine:

*   P/E Effect
*   Size Effect
*   The correlation between Market Capitalization and P/E

Any of these findings that pass the test statistic might stand as the evidence against the Efficient Market Hypothesis in Vietnam. With that purposes, the thesis is designed followed:

\- **Companies Analyzed**: total of 161 companies listed in HoSE, exceptions are discussed on Scope section - **Time Scale**: Mar 1st, 2007 – Mar 1st, 2010. - **Rebalancing Period**: 3 months, on the beginning trading day of March, June, September, and December. Portfolios are restructured each period. Hence, there is 12 three-month periods from March 2007 to March 2010, lead to 12 times the portfolios are restructured. - **P/E Effect Portfolio Design**: Each period (among 12 three-month periods), companies are structured follow their P/E relatively order. The P/E of companies are classified into scale of 5:

*   PE1 – Lowest P/E
*   PE2 – Low P/E
*   PE3 – Moderate P/E (hereafter: Mod P/E)
*   PE4 – High P/E
*   PE5 – Highest P/E

The return of portfolios are calculated each period on daily basis. When five P/E portfolios are constructed with quarterly rebalancing, the daily returns of each portfolio will then be collected throughout the 12 periods. Detail on constructing the study will be discussed in the following sections.

**Size Effect Portfolio Design**: The Size Effect is designed exactly the same manner to P/E Effect. Except the classification of Size are structured as followed:

*   MC1 – Smallest Cap
*   MC2 – Small Cap
*   MC3 – Mid Cap
*   MC4 – Big Cap
*   MC5 – Biggest Cap

\- **Matrix Portfolio of Size and P/E Design**: To establish a matrix between P/E and Size, an important decision comes out: Size will be controlled and P/E will be allocated based on their relative positions to each Size class or vice versa? As the portfolio constructing process, the author realized that P/E tends to volatile dramatically, especially in the smallest cap companies; meanwhile, Size tends to be much more stable and also reliable. Hence, Size are chosen to be the controlled factor and P/E figures will be allocated based on their relative positions among Size class. The categories in matrix of Size and P/E, total 25 categories, are shown below: [![](http://69.195.124.154/~huetrico/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/matrix-of-size-and-pe.png "Matrix of Size and PE")](http://69.195.124.154/~huetrico/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/matrix-of-size-and-pe.png)

\- To sum up, there is 12 three-month periods from March 2007 to March 2010 lead to **12 Reconstructing Periods**. Each period has 35 portfolios constructed included: 25 portfolios from the matrix of P/E and Market Cap, 5 portfolios from P/E alone, and 5 portfolios from the Market Cap. There are total **420 equal weighted portfolios** constructed. - **Abnormal returns** calculated as the premium above/below the **expected returns** – which is calculated by using **CAPM**.

**2\. Source of Information and Data Collection Method** The thesis has a dominant quantitative characteristic, and the research aims to test the past behaviors of stock price related to P/E and Market Cap to predict the future, therefore, the information used in the research is mostly public secondary data. For best practice, the data came mainly from Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange official site: http://www.hsx.vn. Other sites that are also used to collect data, for both using and cross-checking, are: CafeF (http://www.cafef.vn), VietStock (http://www.vietstock.vn/), and VNDirect (http://www.vndirect.com.vn). These sites are chosen after strictly reviewing the data quality and checking for any fraud-motives to give misleading data. The key data that were collected are prices, quarterly earnings, and number of outstanding shares. T-Bill Rate is collected at the official website of the Hanoi Stock Exchange (http://www.hnx.vn).

Particularly: - **Price**: Closing price, taken from VNDirect. - **T-Bill Interest Rate**: Government 5-years Bond quoted, taken from website of Hanoi Stock Exchange. - **Quarterly Profit**: Taken from quarterly report - Unit used: VND 1,000, taken from CafeF, Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange, and VNDirect – Multisource for cross-checking. - **Outstanding Share Numbers**: Market Capitalization of each ticker divided by closing price of designed dates, taken from VietStock.

With a lack of official standardized data bank for stock market in Vietnam, nearly every securities company and researcher have to collect data themselves and this lead to a major danger of accuracy in collecting and processing data. This particular thesis is not out of rule. The used data has to be checked, re-checked, and cross-checked many times for making sure of accuracy with the high cost of time. On the other hand, the date of forming the portfolio chosen in March, June, September, and December effectively eliminates the look-ahead bias that ensures all the public accounting figures are available and ready to use at the portfolio forming date.

**3\. The Study Construction** Based on the initial design, the study was conducted as follow:

**3.1. Data Phase:** 1. Tickers collecting based on their initial listing dates. 2. Allocating tickers into portfolios each three-month period. 3. Data collecting: quarterly profit, outstanding share numbers and prices at designed dates (beginning trading day of each period: March, June, September, and December). 4. Calculating P/E ratios and Market Capitalization at designed dates.

**3.2. Studying of P/E Effect:** 1. Take P/E results from the calculation of step 4 of Data Phase. 2. Divide P/E by scale of 5 (Lowest, Low, Mod, High, and Highest) and reallocate tickers into these categories. 3. Daily returns of each category are then calculated in each period. 4. Synthesize returns throughout 12 periods for each class. 5. Run regression of each category’s returns with market returns to find alpha (i.e. abnormal returns). 6. The anomaly results need to be qualified the test statistic with p-value is less than or equal to 5% (this issue will be addressed in next sections) to be recognized as outperforming. 7. Give conclusion about P/E Effect.

**3.3. Studying of Size Effect:** 1. Take Size results from the calculation of step 4 of Data Phase. 2. Divide Size by scale of 5 (Smallest, Small, Mid, Big, Biggest) and reallocate tickers into these categories. 3. Daily returns of each category are then calculated in each period. 4. Synthesize returns throughout 12 periods for each class. 5. Run regression of each category’s returns with market returns to find alpha. 6. The anomaly results need to be qualified the test statistic with p-value is less than or equal to 5% to be recognized as outperforming. 7. Give conclusion about Size Effect.

**3.4. Studying of Combination Effect of Size and P/E:** 1. Take the results of P/E and Size from the calculation of step 4 of Data Phase. 2. Divide P/E and Market Capitalization by scale of 5 and allocating tickers into matrix portfolios, total 25 portfolios from M1-M25 as shown in the table 1. 3. Collect daily closing price, calculating returns for each portfolio in each period. 4. Synthesize returns of each portfolio during 12 periods 5. Run regression of each category’s returns with market returns to find alpha. 6. The anomaly results need to be qualified the test statistic with p-value is less than or equal to 5% to be recognized as outperforming. 7. Analyze patterns and results and giving conclusions of relations between P/E and Market Cap to anomaly returns.

**3.5. Studying of Correlation between of Size and P/E:** 1. Take the results of P/E and Size from the calculation of step 4 of Data 2. Take mean of Size of each category in each period (exclude extreme 3. Take mean of P/E of each category in each period (exclude extreme 4. Final mean of each category of Size are then synthesized throughout 12 5. Final mean of each category of P/E are then synthesize throughout 12 6. Run correlation model for final means of P/E and Size to find any 7. Draw conclusion about correlation of P/E and Size based on results of correlation model.

**4\. Scope and Stock Selection** As mentioned once in the introduction chapter, the scope of this thesis is limited during March 2007 – March 2010. Companies analyzed each period are listed entities on HoSE that have the initial listing day at least 3 months prior to the portfolio forming date to prevent the instability after IPO (so called the IPO Effect). There also another ticker set that are excluded from the study is fund certificates: VFMVF1, VFMVF1, PRUBF1, and MAFPF1. Therefore, at the first period, March 2007, there is only 63 companies are analyzed; however, at the last period, December 2009, there is total 160 companies are analyzed.

**5\. Key Concepts and Techniques Used** **Trailing P/E**: The P/E used in this research is the Trailing P/E, which is the ratio measure the price pays for earning per share relative to the last most recent 4 quarters profit (adjusted for preferred stocks dividend payout). On reality, there are many kinds of P/E. However, Trailing P/E was chosen because this ratio is also being used by most funds and securities companies as well as individual investors investing in Vietnam recently. Choosing trailing P/E enhances the most conservative and practical approach to the study.

P/E Ratio = Price per share / (Most recent 4 quarters of Earning per share)

**Market Cap** used in the research is the currently share price multiple by the total number of shares outstanding. Market Cap categorization were not set to be fix numbers like over VND 1000 billion as large-cap, however, the categorization used in the research are based on the rank among stocks’ Market Cap. The method also crossed off potentials of unbalanced set of portfolios due to the fluctuation in the market by season.

Market Cap = (Number of share outstanding) x (closing price)

**Arithmetic Return**: Return used in the study is the capital excess or loss during a particular period of testing (3 months for example). Because the portfolios are rebalanced each 3 months, and then reconstruct the portfolio as the change of P/E ratios and size, the return used are Arithmetic Return, as well known for a better measurement over Geometric Return for a specific point of time:

Daily Arithmetic Return for 1 period: Arithmetic Return: ((Portfolio value in time T+1) - (Portfolio value in time T)) / (Portfolio value in time T)

Mean Daily Arithmetic Return: Arithmetic Return = (1/n)\*(Daily return day 1st + ... + Daily return day nth)

**Abnormal Return** is defined as the deviation between the real return and the expected return of each company over a testing period in a particular portfolio and is calculated as follow:

Abnormal Return = (Actual Portfolio Return) - (Expected Portfolio Return)

**Split Adjusting**: The ticker’s returns are adjusted to 0% at the stock split day.

**6\. Hypothesis Testing** The hypothesis testing is a part of statistical inference, the process of making judgments about a population based on its sample. To this point, what the thesis is trying to do is to try to make a conclusion about behavior of VNIndex (as a population) based on P/E and Size through 746 daily returns observations of total 161 companies analyzed in HoSE during 2007-2010. The value of alphas found in P/E Effect test, Size Effect test, or combination effect of both Size and P/E are then tested under this phase. This last hypothesis testing part try to answer the question “Is the value of alpha equal to 0 (zero)? To answer this question, a hypothesis is then established that the value of alpha that is equal to zero as null hypothesis: H0: μα = 0 – The mean of alpha is equal zero H1: μα ≠ 0 – The mean of alpha is statistically significant different from zero This is a two-tailed hypothesis test, that we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis if the evidence about alpha is found to be both statistical significant smaller or larger than 0.

After stating the hypothesis, the next problem approached as: which test statistic is chosen for deciding whether or not to reject the null hypothesis. There are 4 most popular kind of tests statistic:

*   The t-test
*   The z-test
*   The chi-square test
*   The F-test

The decision to choose any kind of these tests depends on the distribution of the samples that the thesis is testing. The chi-square test and F-test are easily phased out due to their specific characteristics in testing variance rather than mean. Moreover, chi-square test and F-test are family of asymmetrical distribution and bounded from below by 0.  Therefore, the decision of choosing test statistic is shorten to 2: between z-test and t-test.

Let’s take a look through the distribution of the sample. First of all, the nature of the study is Time-Series with 746 observations (as daily returns) from March 2007 to March 2010. Referred to the Central Limit Theorem: “Given a population described by any probability distribution having mean μ and finite variance σ2, the sampling distribution of the sample mean X computed from samples of size n from this population will be approximately normal with mean μ (the population mean) and variance σ2/n (the population variance divided by n) when the sample size n is large” (CFA Level 1 Program Curriculum – Volume 1, “Ethical and Professional Standards and Quantitative Methods”, pages 482). Moreover, the Central Limit Theorem contains the power to make relatively accurate probability statements about the population’s parameters by using the sample mean despite the distribution of the population. Lastly, in general, sample size n is considered large when n is greater or equal to 30. Therefore, based on the Central Limit Theorem, with a series of 746 observations, the sample size is large enough to conclude the distribution of the sample is approximately normal. With a sample size n in the thesis of 746 observations we can have general conclusions:

*   The distribution of sample mean will be approximately normal
*   Mean of the sample will be roughly equal to the mean of the population (here is VNIndex)
*   The variance of the sample will be roughly equal to the variance of the population.

Therefore, with the conclusion of sample distribution to be approximately normal and sample size is large enough, both t-distribution and z-alternative are both eligible to be used to test the null hypothesis. However, in this thesis, t-test is strongly preferred over z-test due to many reasons: (1) The population variance is unknown. It’s hard to draw a conclusion about the VNIndex variance, or any particular indexes variance. Most of the studies conducted in the stock market generally admit that the population variance is unknown. This reasoning is strongly preferred t-test over z-test. Generally, z-test is more accurate when population variance is known. (2) Generally, the t-test is a more conservative approach to z-test. This means that in the large sample examples, the t-distribution provides more-conservative (wider) confidence interval. (3) t-test is robust; therefore, it can moderate departures from normality, except for outliers and strong skewness. Additional, the theoretically correct reliability factor is based on the t-distribution when the confidence intervals based on samples that are approximately normal distribution with unknown variance of population. To sum up, t-test is chosen over z-test to test statistic in the findings of this thesis.

Finally, the decision of significant level and p-value is considered. There are generally 3 most popular confidence intervals based on the standard normal distribution: 90 percent, 95 percent, and 99 percent according to three conventional significance levels of 0.10, 0.05, and 0.01. With 0.10 level of significance, we have some evidence that the null hypothesis is rejected. With 0.05 level of significance, we have strong evidence that the null hypothesis is false. And with 0.01 level of significance, we claim very strong evidence that the null hypothesis is false. Within the scope of this thesis, a significance level of 0.05, or a confidence interval of 95% is chosen. Moreover, this thesis applies the p-value concept which states the smallest level of significance at which the null hypothesis can be rejected and generally, the smaller p-value, the stronger the evidence against the null hypothesis. Therefore, with the significance level of 0.05, we will reject null hypothesis of alpha equal to zero in the results whose p-value is equal to 5% or below. On the other hand, if the p-value is higher than 5%, the null hypothesis will not be rejected and the abnormal performance does not have statistic meaning, hence, the result is not reliable for investment strategy.

One last advantage of using p-value in deciding the rejection of null hypothesis is that in case audiences want to do the test statistic with different confidence intervals (says, 90% or 99% instead of 95% as stated in this thesis), p-value is easily used to state out their findings. For example, with a 99% confidence intervals, the rejecting point of p-value would be 1%, instead of 5% as stated in this thesis. This particular approach, as academic researchers called, is called the p-value approach to hypothesis testing.
