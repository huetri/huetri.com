This post is the last following of [Price movement - market proxies (1) ](https://huetri.com/2012/01/18/price-movements/ "Price movement - market proxies (1)")and [Price movement - diagnosis (2)](https://huetri.com/2012/01/24/price-movement-diagnosis/ "Price movement - diagnosis (2)") on studying the price movement - the ruling factor of the market.

Breaking down the price movements will be an extremely ambitious task, however it's worth trying.  In the first note I've introduced about the importance price movements as well as how different strategies formed based on perceptions of investors on it.  Then in the second note I've continued to break it down to several factors that can somehow reflect (reflect, not explain) the true movements of the price itself.  I'll go on to discuss some additional facets that might affect to the actions of prices.

**\- (3) Some additional facets - **

I think we'll never have a system that can explain "why" price move that way or this way even that knowing "why" may provide a great conviction for any investment.  "Why" is actually a matter of case by case basis and that's the final fundamental.  However, many people mistake "why" as the underlying fundamental of an issue (securities, bonds, whatever), in fact, "why" is not the underlying fundamental of an issue but a perception of investors on that fundamental.  It's just like people don't see the truth itself but see the "truth" through the lens of themselves.  On the other hand, the "what", from my opinion, is somewhat more systematically approachable.  The previous note tackled the "what" of the price movements internally, however, there are some "external factors" such as market biases and players which are also worth considering.

To begin with, market bias may be an extremely important factor for investing.  For example, equity markets have the tendency to be upward bias, meanwhile bond markets and foreign exchange market have the tendency to be more neutral.  Therefore, in equity, people tend to play long side much more heavily comparing to short side.  The upward bias is even more prominent in developing and frontier countries because the financial infrastructure in these countries limit or totally prohibit the short side.  Foreign exchange is much more neutral.  Even though there are some big themes of countries and the relations between countries that govern the relative price of a currency versus another currencies in a relatively long period like 10 years or more, the movements tend to be cyclical.  From balance of payment point of view, price of a currency is reflected through supply and demand of that currency with all other currencies. Those supply and demand mostly come from current account (mostly import & export) and financial account (mostly international loan, foreign direct investment, and foreign portfolio investment).  Because a country's import and export position changes over time as well as attractiveness of investment climate in a country changes over time.  Demand of that particular currency changes over time too.  On the supply side, monetary policies also change over time with interest rate ups and downs.  Therefore, even a country might emerge and be very attractive to foreign investors, but if that country uses a lot of accommodating monetary policies - supply might well overwhelm demand and the currency may well depreciate.  A currency depreciation, in addition, doesn't necessary mean bad or good.  Put another hand, in equity it's pretty clear that price goes up is a mostly good signal, everyone wants prices to go up.  In currency, the price of a country's money goes along with the position of that country versus positions of another countries.  Therefore a currency that is "cheap" or "expensive" depends a lot of monetary policies and what the government is trying to achieve.  Such as export-led growth always want a currency to depreciate.  We are facing to a problem that almost all countries want to employ the model of export-led growth and they all want to debase their currencies: China, Japan, Switzerland, a bunch of emerging countries, and even now with the US.  The problem is, a currency value is related to another currencies' values, therefore there can't be the case that all currencies is cheap versus each other.  Turn back to our topic on market bias, so I think knowing the market bias may provide a significant support on defining the direction.  The drawback: sometimes the theme comes exhaustive and the whole course turns around - it would be extremely costly when the bias blinds you from seeing the truth.

The structure of the market, the way the market is established, also adds an additional hint to read the price movements.  Let's take double auction market and dealer market for example.  In double auction, the sellers sell directly to the buyers through a central facility.  Mostly the buyers will try to buy as low as possible, meanwhile the sellers try to sell as high as possible.  They will independently submit their bids and asks and bargain directly through the movements of the price tape.  This is the way Vietnam's listed stock exchange is organized.  Dealer market, on the other hand, is the market where buyers don't buy directly from the sellers but there are market makers who stand in between and simultaneously buy from the sellers and sell to the buyers.  This is the way US stock markets such as NYSE or even foreign exchange market are organized.  The implications for reading price movements in these two types of market are enormously different.  First, it is harder to read the dealer market's intraday price tape.  Because the prices that are quoted depend on the situation of the dealers more than depend on the buy side alone or sell side alone.  For example if a dealer sees that it has excessive EUR in hand and it wants to reduce EUR exposure, it might quote a sell (ask) EUR price that are more attractive versus other dealers and therefore get rid of those excessive EUR.  We almost never know what is going on from the other side of the market because dealers already stand in between like a black curtain.  In double auction, reading the tape quoted intraday might be an extremely interesting practice.  Some of the factors should be taken into account are: the speed of orders getting in and out of the market, the size of orders, the relative positions of those orders versus the current position of the market, and so on.  And through reading all of them we can try to answer some questions like: are the sharks getting in? are the sharks getting out? are they trying to bluffing the buy side with large fake buy waiting orders and simultaneously sell their position? are they trying to accumulate through a many small size orders to not let the market notice? or are they trying to get the notices from the market by using large size orders and doing something else? who are losing the patience, the sellers or the buyers? and so on.

Current market quality might also be important.  Is the market strong and active? is liquidity abundant? is price continuous or disruptive? is news reflected timely?  Market quality may change, and change dramatically.  Take liquidity for an example, liquidity may be a function reflects market confidence.  When people are optimistic and ignorant, liquidity is abundant and market quality is therefore high, because leverage might be maximized and people try to pursue all of the opportunities.  However when the market starts to crash followed a well-known/expected reasons, liquidity might drop significantly, price movements might be extremely choppy, and the market quality might be deteriorated dramatically.  A drop in liquidity doesn't mean money has been disappeared, but it means people are really frightening.  An opposite conclusion might be taken for markets at their peak of confidence.  The same phenomenon can also be observed when markets are at their troughs: low range, choppy price movement, discontinuous price movement, low liquidity, and so on.  Given all of these analysis, we can draw a conclusion that because liquidity is a function of confidence and public psychology, it tends to go cyclical.  Therefore excessive liquidity might be an important signal for the market peak: people has leverage to the max, all potential buyers have got into the train, people are extremely optimistic and ignorant, and so on.  This observation can be seen best in equity market.  Then the market will change from accumulating phrase to distributing phrase: smart money starts to get out, leverage turns deleverage, and so on.

But there is one factor that is so premium to be ignored and so premium to really get it: understanding about the market players.  Take foreign exchange for example, it is a mess that unites all of the roads in the world to a crossroad with thousands of red-yellow-green traffic lights and thousands of creatures: ducks, birds, Iraqi, monks, robots, cars, trains, planes, camels, whales, vikings soldiers, whatever and whoever.  Each class of players has their own purposes and therefore their activities are also very different from each other.  For example, Japanese exporters are one of the major source of selling USD to buy JPY after they exported.  The interesting thing is they tend to stand very closely to each other and go to the market the same time at the same levels - that makes the price action spike in a very short-time and remains sleepy the rest of the time.  One additional interesting thing is that given the low rate in Japan, trillions worth of Japanese funds typically invest globally for better returns.  When the investment climate deteriorates, the force of this class to repatriate their asset plus with the safe haven status of Japanese currency & sovereignty bonds create a huge rush into JPY.  That makes the JPY even a stronger safe haven currency versus the Swiss Franc in tumbling times.  Finally, Japanese asset management community tends to respect the round numbers, chase price conservatively, and respect the technical levels.  Therefore, in USD/JPY cross, the round numbers like 75.5, 76.5, 78.25 so on might interestingly identical with technical levels, option barriers, and limit orders.  All of the above three characteristics are very unique to Japanese Yen that can't be found in other currencies.

The above factors are surely not an exhaustive list.  Actually, the market isn't established to be solved.  The market is like a puzzle that continuously encrypts itself.  When we try to decode the market, we actually simultaneously encrypt it to the next level - just like many other market players.  Some get it right, and some get it wrong.  But for that, these cycles will never end.
