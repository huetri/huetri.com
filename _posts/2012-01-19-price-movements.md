If there is one market factor that is "One Ring to rule them all", it will be no doubt that the price movement is that only One Ring.  Effectively, price movements are the proxy of all proxies, the sum of entire market participants' expectations and valuations, the combination of public psychology including all greed and fear, and the sources of other market valuations that are deprived from the price movements themselves.

From business perspective, before the capitalism's free market got the throne in Western economies, and now the world, in early 17th century - businessmen from every continent had had a long-standing interest in controlling the price factor.  That is monopoly - the highest possible state of a business in a world without regulations.  Monopoly brings market power; this market power goes along with corruption and exploitation of other market players as well as of the end-users that maximizes the monopoly's profit margin.  In business, the one who has power to influence the price is the ruler.

In investment, who understands price movements gets the key to the market's maze.  Sadly, almost no-one gets that key forever and almost no-one knows how to get that key forever.  Like people on their dreams to search for a holy grail, that holy grail is not yet to be found.  Nevertheless, it is extremely interest to form some ideas about this issue.

**\- (1) Market Proxies** -

The market is designed to be simple.  I often take this over simplistic view: the market has only one product, and there is a group of people who buy and sell (in this case, sell means short selling) this one product.  The price of this product can only go up or down, and people can only buy or sell.  Thus, we have a combination of: buy/sell for the actions and up/down for the price movements.  There are 2 cases for an investor to win: to buy and the price goes up or to sell and the price goes down.  Otherwise, an investor can also face two cases for losing: to buy and the price goes down or to sell and the price goes up.  In reality, this simplicity causes so many people to go broke and establishes a huge asset management industry with hundreds of thousands of professionals analyzing everything 24/7 just to make sure the price goes up eventually after they buy (with an acceptable volatility and time range) and the price goes down eventually after they sell.  This force, the investment industry, has a close relationship with the wider financial industry as well as all other industries or even with political factors.

Think back, you'll be surprised by how much investment and asset management industry are afraid of the price movements.  They invent enormous strategies with different combinations of key factors such as time frame, target return, risk profile, volatility exposure, and valuation method.  If you operate in an extremely short time frame, target to very small returns with tight stop losses, and employ statistics-only valuation models, then you'll arrive something similar to high frequency trading (as known as HFT).  On the another hand, if you lengthen time frame to a day, analyze profit and risk based on intra-day range volatility, and apply a trading model based chiefly on technical analysis and catalyst-driven news, then you'll arrive day traders' houses.  Take another extreme, private equity firms who invest in closely held companies lengthen the time frame to as much as ten years, aim for high target returns of 10x-30x, and control risk through fundamental analysis, management consulting, and legal clauses between the business owners, management, and the fund.  Private equity firms almost smooth out all the market volatility risks during their holding period, yet they still expose this risk significantly at the beginning (entry) and the ending (exit) of the deals.  Other players such as hedge funds , mutual funds, venture capitals, and other market players employ different combinations of these key factors.

Put it another way, the differences of the above players in their mindsets and strategies result from the differences in their willingness to approach price movements.  People are far more afraid of losing a particular amount of capital than gaining the same amount of capital.  Hence, the further I go on studying finance and trying new ideas, the further I see how investment/finance centralize around risk.  So, what is risk?  From a down to the Earth perspective, risk is the price drop after you buy and the price increase after you sell (short selling).  Because nobody knows where the price will go tomorrow, they try using other indicators as proxies to anticipate tomorrow's prices.  There are numerous types of proxies.  A proxy can be unpublished news somewhere from a friend of a friend that you think will make price goes up tomorrow - this is a rumor.  A proxy can also be hours of studying and analyzing company reports with enormous of ratios and scrunched numbers - this is fundamental financial analysis.  Another typical approach is the statistics/math/computer science approach.  Some funds, particularly hedge funds who focus on statistics, gather tons of data about prices and volume to write algorithms based solely on price movements and bet accordingly to the repetitions of identified probability of particular statistical relationships - mostly exploit volatility.

Sometimes, I feel lost between all of those proxies, and I feel like most people go too far too fast on studying and applying those proxies without stepping back and asking some conceptual questions such as why do prices go up? and down? How effective are those proxies to predict the market or to hedge risk? What are the links between proxies and prices and why? Who determines the prices? who are the market players? what do they think and why and how they reflect what they think? what are the constrains of each market players? how does psychology affect prices? and how does public psychology affect prices in both normal market conditions and extreme situations?

You still have one product that can either buy or sell.  Fairly speaking, when you buy, you have 50% chance of prices go up and 50% chance of prices go down.   Now, the simplicity of prices up and down doesn't look simple at all.
