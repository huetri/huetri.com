<span style="text-decoration: underline;">A note from May 16th, 2012:</span> This is my graduating thesis at International University - Vietnam National University in Summer 2010\.  Through out the study, I found that there are correlations between Price-earnings (P/E) ratio, Size factor, and combination of the two toward a better stock value appreciation (attributed to alpha).  There are a lot of studies on the same factors toward anomaly returns have been conducted in various different countries in the most recent tens years.  However, at the time I did the research two years ago, given the young nature of Vietnamese stock market (less than 10 years at the time), I did not find any applicable study on the same subject.  Thought it would add value to investors I decided to public the thesis in here.  The reader should carefully examine the Limitation Section in chapter one, as there are various statistical biases might well unexpectedly affect the findings (such as Time-Period bias and Sample Selection bias).  Besides, given a lot of market developments in the last two years, I think the predictive power of the findings should have been logically reduced.

I eliminated the details of Acknowledgement section as I think it is personal.  However, I keep full gratitude toward these persons who helped me during that period, namely: **Prof. Le Hong Nhung**, **Nguyen Thi Kim Thao**, **Pham Ngoc Tram Anh**, **Nguyen Thi Diem Anh**, **Vo Thien Thanh**, **Le Van Nhat Tuan**, **Dang Quoc Dung**, **Nguyen Thi Thanh Thao**, **Ton Nu Ai Phuong**, **Phan Anh Nhat**, **Phan Thi Bich Phuong**, **Ton That Viet Hung**, **Phan Thi Thanh Huong**, and **Ton Nu Hue Nhan**.  Specially, I want to express my deepest gratitude toward my guiding professor **Le Hong Nhung**.  Somehow the potential of conflict of interests between student-professor relationship restrained me to show how much I admired her.  Yet, I always thank her for making my last university year especially practical for a future-investor and memorable for a then-student.

I dedicated this thesis for my private equity firm **VI Group**: "The place tells me where I should belong to".

**Abstract**

As the rise of the style investment worldwide, many researches and studies came on scene to test the validity of the Efficient Market Hypothesis. Among them, some most famous effects found included: P/E Effect, Size Effect, Calendar Effect, IPO Effect, etc. With the evolving of Vietnamese stock markets, especially VNIndex, this thesis tries to find out the anomaly returns due to P/E Effect, Size Effect, and the combination effect of P/E and Size during the period of 2007-2010\. A total of 161 chosen companies are structured into final 35 portfolios based on different ranks in relative position of P/E and Size. Throughout 12 three-month portfolio reconstructuring periods, 746 daily returns observations are recognized and regression models are established. Finally, P/E Effect is found but contradictory to much prediction, neither lowest or highest P/E group outperformed the market but the moderate P/E class did it. Size Effect is also recognized with the outperforming of smallest market capitalization companies. The combination effect of Size and P/E are also realized with positive alphas generally belong to lowest market cap and lowest P/E groups. Mid cap and moderate P/E are also recognized as beating the market. However, poor results are found in big market capitalization and high P/E class with lowest mean returns over the period which associated to negative abnormal returns. A correlation test of Size and P/E did not find any special influence between the two. Take transaction costs into the findings did not make any significant alter to the results.
