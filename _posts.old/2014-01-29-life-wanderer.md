Life Wanderer (ePNX Theme) – Tri Ton

"... For the piece, I composed it under the influence of a soundtrack format.  In the movie, a theme song of a character will be played most of the time the character appears.  So basically, the structure of the piece has no ending.  The song can, theoretically, go on forever whenever the character is still appearing, doing anything on the scene..."
