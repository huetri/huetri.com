**CHAPTER I**

**INTRODUCTION**

_“The ancient Sumerians attempted to divine meaning from examining the entrails of dead animals. We examine the behavior of residuals that affect the earnings/price (E/P) ratio, and use these residuals to predict future market returns.”_ _Donna Dudney, Benjamas Jirasakuldech, & Thomas Zorn - 2008_

**1\. Background Context** Back to the ancient world of early 17th century, when the Amsterdam Stock Exchange was first established, the stock market since then has become one of the key backbones that reflect the well-being of the economy for most of developed and developing countries. It is well-known that the economy’s strengths and primary characteristics are well reflected on the behavior of the stock market, or, the stock market is the mirror of the whole economy. Therefore, unsurprisingly, the stock market has attracted a large number of theories and studies on trying to understand it and, especially, to beat it, with consistent anomaly positive returns.

Now front to the young Vietnamese stock markets, under the infancy period of their birth, Vietnam’s stock markets are already famous for their irrationalness of cannot-understandable behaviors. And, it is perceived that under these periods, there are both more generous opportunities and also more deadly risks to investors that call for studying more and more on it. Actually, the beautiful era of investing in Vietnam has just begun.

**2\. Rationale of the Study** In the world scale, there are many studies toward the stock market to find out any speculative chance to get superior returns with available public information, and this leads to many different methods of investment. Among them, Price Earnings Ratio (hereafter: P/E) is obviously one of the most popular factors for the style investment in decision-making. Interestingly, researchers showed that P/E Effect existed in only some markets and that phenomenon did not appear clearly in other markets. The different times of studying also leads to different results: in some particular period, P/E showed strong relation to abnormal returns, in other periods, P/E Effect did not show well. Moreover, many securities companies, funds, and individual investors in Vietnam also use P/E as a key criterion for their investment rule. Therefore, an academic analysis on P/E is needed for ensuring the accuracy of using this ratio in current period of Vietnamese stock markets.

The second factor that affects much the investment strategies is the Market Capitalization (hereafter: Market Cap, or MC). As traditional thinking about the stock market, blue-chips are safe stocks with low fluctuations, and penny stocks are highly fluctuated and also bring higher returns. However, researches also showed that the fluctuated characteristics between blue-chips and pennies were very different depend on the markets and taste of market participants. Without any empirical test for the fluctuation and behavior of both pennies and blue-chips, it is unreasonable to give a conclusion that invests in any class between pennies and blue-chips would give a better return. A deeper analysis on Market Cap will also help investors understand insights of the behaviors of different size classes that finally adds value to their investing works.

Last of all, the combination relationship of P/E and Market Cap toward the stock return is absolutely meaningful evidence if there is any. A test of this relationship will provide a somewhat meaningful view about investment policies and answer the question whether P/E and Market Cap together can be used as indicator for abnormal returns or not. Additionally, there are no tested academic guidelines for effectively investing by style, especially through P/E and size in Vietnamese stock markets yet, despite of a lot of securities companies, funds, and individual investors are using P/E as a main indicator and Market Cap as a significance figure to invest nowadays in Vietnam. Those are strong motives for this thesis to be conducted.

**3\. Study Objectives** The study has three main purposes: - Investigates the P/E Effect. - Investigates the Size Effect. - Investigates the relationship between P/E and Market Cap, as correlated factors, to abnormal returns.

From those main objectives, the thesis also gives comments to: - Correlations between Market Cap and P/E. - The validity of Efficient Market Hypothesis in Vietnam’s context.

**4\. Scope, Limitations, and Suggestions for further Studies** **4.1\. Scope** The scale of the study limits at Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange (hereafter: HoSE) as known as VNIndex. Vietnam has two most popular stock indexes: VNIndex and HNX-Index, a study of both indexes will give a better view about Vietnam stock behaviors. However, on the limitation of time and condition, VNIndex is chosen because of its leading role toward the whole country performance. Moreover, the late-born, relatively illiquid, and highly speculative characteristic of HNX-Index are also major limitations to the empirical study that might mislead the results of the research.

Another factor, the timing of the research are limited from 2007 to 2010 will also be another limitation. The reason behind this decision is because VNIndex as well as the stock situation in Vietnam was not so developed and noticeable prior to 2006\. The market went side-way steadily from 2002 to the beginning of 2006\. And with the spark of 2006, 2007 continued as a milestone to the whole course with the increase in value, liquidity, supply of stock, and demand from investors. Therefore a study since 2007 is thought to be both efficient and effective without missing any characteristics of the market.

**4.2\. Limitations** Actually, the infancy of the HoSE, with around ten years history, would pose a hard question in any study on it for the sustainability of discovered phenomena. Whether these phenomena contain plausible economic rationales for why it worked and if it continues to work on a sustainable basis? Whether it has the predictive power? These questions lead to another hard-nosed question of Time-Period Bias in probability and statistics that might turn down the results: the results are time-period specific and may not reflect a longer period. Therefore, a study of the same factors, P/E ratio and Market Cap, on a longer time span would absolutely more favorable.

Another major limitation to the thesis is the potential of Sample Selection Bias. The thesis excluded certain kind of stocks due to many reasons, included data availability, avoidance of IPO Effect, etc. that might affect to the validity of the results. Other objective factors like delisting of companies from HoSE or quarterly earnings with the risk of unaudited accounting profit also might lead to the Sample Selection Bias. In the thesis, the issue of delisting was cared carefully; however, the potential of Sample Selection Bias is still a threat to the validity of the result due to data availability.

**4.3\. Suggestions for further Studies** This particular thesis also open many other ways for further study on Vietnamese stock markets. A matrix combination between: P/E, Size, and Industry would give a more precise look on how industrial factors, especially industrial cycle, influence on stock prices. Price-Earning/Growth Ratio, January Effect, Week-end Effect, Quarter-End Effect, and Surprising Fourth-Quarter Earnings Effect, also need to be analyzed alongside with Size and P/E to find whether these effects exist on Vietnamese stock markets and whether correlation Size and P/E are any stronger due to that particular event effect are also further ways to explore the P/E and Size relationship.

**5\. Implication of the Study** **5.1\. Benefit for Academic Studies** There are many reasons for researches on the stock market in Vietnam are still in minority. This research aims to place a small stone on an attempt to understand and test whether theories from advanced countries can be applied to Vietnam’s stock markets. On economics side, a test of bias return will be a proof for Efficient Market Hypotheses, and the results of relationship between P/E and Market Cap might bring researchers to further study on any chance to speculate Vietnam stock market based on academic studying.

**5.2\. Benefit for Investors** The research will provide meaningful information for investors to consider in their strategies on Ho Chi Minh stock market, especially those who stress on style investment strategy. The ambitious side of the thesis is to try to provide effective and efficient proof for investment professionals to develop their style investment method based on P/E and size.

**6\. Structure of the Thesis** There are five chapters in this thesis which the structure of this thesis is clearly shown from the table of content. The introduction part lays in the chapter 1\. Chapter 2 and 3 discuss about literature review and study design respectively. Chapter 4 shows the empirical test and discusses the results: whether any relations between P/E ratio and Market Capitalization, as stand-alone factor as well as correlated factors, to anomaly returns which help investors and researchers can take advantage to understand more the HoSE. Then, conclusion of the thesis locates in chapter 5.
