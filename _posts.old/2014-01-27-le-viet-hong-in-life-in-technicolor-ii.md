Viet Hong and Anh Uyen happen to be my top care couple personally and top respect business persons professionally.  I have the privilege to work with Hong under many angles.  Started with the ambitious Green Bike project in 2007, when Hong united a team of young, inexperience, and dynamic individuals to do what New York is doing now with its CitiBike (that I paid USD ~30 for a week of riding bike around Mid and Upper Manhattan).  The project failed - but what remains remarkable is after years, the team now has feet in Cambridge and Harvard and has minds being entrepreneurs and deal makers.  What awes me all of the time is how he gathered the team at the first place.  Besides being an entrepreneur at heart and co-founded DeltaViet, Lifebox, iTracker, and Cloudjet Solutions, he walked from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi in 3 months to raised a cancer fund.  We have never had a boring conversation and Hong's ideas challenge mine all of the time.  Hong, as with other people I (luckily) have, makes me feel it's the most awesome thing in the world to have the most awesome people around you and going into the same awesome direction for what matters.
