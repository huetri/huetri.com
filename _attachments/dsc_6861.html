excerpt: Portland is a weird and interesting city.  Excepting from its raining that
  depresses me every time, it is a beautiful city with old architecture at downtown
  and exceptionally nice people.  Even though Portland is not a major financial center
  such as New York, not a main management consulting hub such as Chicago, and not
  the future of US such as Bay Area.  It retains some of US's largest and notable
  corporations' factories and headquarters (Nike, Intel, etc).  Before my trip back
  to Vietnam in Late Feb.  Coincidentally I had a very nice conversation with Kurt
  Welty, Commodity Manager at Intel, on his trip to Las Vegas.  He led some of large
  negotiation deals in Intel strategic sourcing  all around the world.  I didn't miss
  the chance to learn about his experience through his sharing, on what are perceived
  to be his largest interests around his negotiation tables.  What he likes and what
  he doesn't.  What he did and what he is going to do.  We talked and shared about
  schools, works, countries, travels, markets, and everything during our waiting time
  before boarding.  It's not always that warmness when you go around, here and there.  But
  mostly if we dare to explore, turn to the next person and start a conversation -
  I believe those meetings are the best presents that we take home. - 2013 Feb
