excerpt: 'One of my favorite spot in VIG - this picture is taken by a great friend/colleague
  of mine at the end of September 2012.  To me a great friend of value is the one
  who will make my face looks like this.  Because we won''t normally talk about easy
  things.  In our normal discussions, we challenge each other''s perspective by posing
  some of very straight and tough questions.  After all, that was the way I have grown
  up.  And that will be the way I want to grow up.  Courtesy: Thao Ly - 2013 Feb'
